-   Enabled many transistors to be grouped into a single package
-   Lowered cost and decreased space compared to using individual transistors
-   Today exceeding 30 billion transistors in a single package of 4 square inches.
-   Still the building blocks for all modern electronics today
First commercial use of the IC was in a pocket calculator - 1961
