# Artificial Intelligence  
Can Computers Think?

## What is AI?
-   It is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs.
-   Artificial Intelligence is the study of the computations that make it possible to perceive, reason and act.
## Artificial Intelligence
-   Artificial intelligence is concerned with understanding the nature of intelligence through the creation of computer programs which control machines.
-   It is normally divided up into various sub-disciplines such as vision, learning, language, planning, motion, etc.
## Artificial Intelligence
-   Artificial Intelligence becomes a formal branch of Computer Science around 1956
-   AI has its own computer programming languages LISP, which developed in 1957, is STILL in use today, along with others
-   Every major computer technology company has a considerable investment in AI research
## The Mind-Body Problem
-   The major philosophical issue related to AI in computer science is the mind-body problem -- how the mind relates to the body as espoused by Rene Descartes
## Mental Life
-   People (and presumably some animals) have a mental life.
-   Consider the question “what would it be like to be a bat?”
-   Mental life is made up of sensations (color, pain, smells, touch,etc.), emotions and  thoughts etc.
## The Mind Body Paradox
1 - Bodies are physical.
2 - Minds are not physical.
3 - Minds and bodies interact. 
4 - The physical and non-physical can't interact. 
Any three of this propositions are compatible but all four together are not….  
## Cartesian Dualism
-   Cartesian dualism as espoused by Rene Descartes claims that mental activity is governed by different laws, and is made up of different stuff than purely physical activity.
-   The major problem with this theory for science is that nobody has every seen such stuff, or observed such laws.
## Physicalism
-   Physicalism  contends that mental activity and physical brain activity are the same thing.
Here is Where Computers Enter the Picture.
-   Computers today to some degree make physicalism seem less plausible. 
-   “What is it like to be an Apple iBook?”
-   Presumably our answer would be “not much”.
-   Would our answer change if the computer were talking to us and having a conversation?   
## So, Can Computers Think?
Not yet…but who knows what the future holds in store?
-   Either way there are important philosophical ramifications.
## The “Chinese Room” Problem
-   Imagine a person sitting in a room, and who does not understand Chinese. 
-   This person is given a manual on how to respond to all possible sequences of Chinese symbols.
-   To the outside world, the person in the room seems to understand Chinese, but does not.
-    The same should be said about computers.
## Just Wait for Our Intuitions to Change!
Many things that we currently take for granted at one time seemed very implausible.
-   Computation and logic can be carried out in the absence of consciousness.
## The Promise of AI
-   Some Machines that “Think”, or at least give the appearance that they do….
-   Robots
-   Expert Systems
-   Automation
-   Natural Language Processors
## Results To Date
-   Software that analyzes other systems and software
-   Software that “learns” and never forgets

-   Very reliable robotic systems at decreasing cost
-   Problem Solvers
-   Computer Chess and other Games

## Some Areas and Applications of AI Research
-   Game Theory
-   Speech and Language Recognition
-   Machine Vision
-   Expert Systems (Learning)
-   Robotics
-   Heuristic Classification (what should I do?)
## Machine (Computer) Vision
-   Computer vision is concerned with reconstructing the objects and their placement in a scene from one or more  arrays of light intensities generated by these objects.
-   It is a very complicated problem.
-   That we and other animals do it so effortlessly speaks highly of evolution.
## Line Detection
-   Early vision (things that are done early in the vision process) is generally concerned with line detection.
-   Lines are places where there is a sharp change in light intensities.
-   Noise often complicates things, so it is necessary to smooth the observed light intensities.
Three Causes of Lines
Line caused by reflectance change.
Line caused by object orientation change.
Line caused by object boundary.
## Early Vision and It’s Uses
-   So far we have been talking about early vision:  line detection, stereo, texture.
-   Some tasks require not much more than this, e.g. driving a car on a highway.
## Object Recognition
-   More advanced machine vision is concerned with object recognition.
-   Problem involve how to represent object shapes and sizes, how to map such representations when an object is seen at different angles

## Some Applications for Object Recognition
-   Manufacturing Quality Control
-   Medical Research

-   Navigation over terrain (Guidance systems)
-   Facial Analysis (Security Systems)
-   Robots

## Object recognition in    manufacturing

## Machine Learning
-   Machine learning is the creation of new hypotheses by computers (or at least hypotheses new to the computer).
-   Today most machine learning programs use statistical techniques, and there is, in general, a great cross fertilization between Statistics and Artificial Intelligence.
## Planning
-   Planning is deciding what action to take next.
-   Within AI planning problems are generally thought of as coming in two varieties:  planning with and without complete information.
## Game Playing
-   One standard planning problem is game playing.
-   Games like chess are examples of planning with complete information since one knows the exact state of the game board, and nothing else affects the play of the game

Game Trees with known rules
My possible first moves.
Initial state of the board
State after move 1
State after move 2
My opponents possible moves.
State after move 2 followed by  my opponents move 1
## Using the Game Tree
-   In principle one can decide on a move by considering all possible responses to responses …
-   In practice one cannot carry this out to the end of the game..
-   So one carries it out as far as one can….
## Chess Playing
-   Many of the worlds best chess players are computers.
-   A computer (IBM’s Deep Blue) beat the Gary Kasparov, the world champion in 1997 in a one on one tournament using the tree technique..
## Number of possible moves in a chess game
-   There are over 288 billion different possible positions after four moves each. The number of distinct 40-move games is far greater than the number of electrons in the observable universe…..
## Pretending the Information is Perfect
-   In many cases one needs to plan without perfect information, scheduling a factory floor, airport terminal gates, transportation of supplies.
-   If things break down, or don’t arrive, analyze the result and re-plan
## Planning Under Uncertainty
-   Some of the time, however, the future is very uncertain.
-   Should one send an airplane to pick up people if you are not sure where the people are, if the airplane will make it, or if they really want to be picked up?
## Utility Theory
-   A standard tool for reasoning in such situations is utility theory.
-   Actions have costs, and possible outcomes with certain probabilities.  Do the action for which the sum of P(outcome)*Utility of outcome - cost is the greatest.
## Speech Recognition and Natural Language Programs

  -   Very difficult problem
-   Recognizing words and simple phrases vs. complex thoughts and syntax
-   Cultural nuance and Context
-   Pattern recognition on different speech patterns and accents
-   Used by the “Turing test” as the ultimate test of computer intelligence
## The Loebner Prize ($100K)
-   Awarded each year to the computer program that best responds to a team of human questioners and best mimics another human being in what is called the “Turing Test”
-   Turing asked the question, “ If a computer could be made to think, how would we tell?”…have a conversation with it…..?
## Chat bots
A Chat bot is a program that attempts to simulate typed conversation, with the aim of at least temporarily fooling a human into thinking they were talking to another person. 
Chat bots are lightweight Natural Language Programs.

## Heuristics
-   For a given set of circumstances, what should be done?
-   What information can be used as input into the decision process?
-   What weight should be given to different pieces of data?
example: approving a credit card purchase   
## Robotics
-   The ultimate exercise in planning and action is in the area of robotics.

-   The current state of robotics is still fairly primitive.  Our sensors typically do not tell us much about the environment with much certainty, and our effectors do not work all that well either.

## Robotic Sensors
-   Infared
-   Lasers
-   Temperature

-   Humidity
-   Liquid
-   Micro Switches  
A practical robotic example
-   Self driving cars!

## IBM’s Artificial Brain
-   IBM has recently unveiled its Blue Gene Artificial Brain.
-   Has the computing power of a cat’s brain but is only 1/83rd as fast as a human brain
-   Consists of 147,000 interconncted processors and consumes 1,000,000 watts of power and has 150,000 Gigabytes of memory!

## Self Awareness
-   Can machines be made Self-Aware?
-   Implies that at some point they might not need further programming….they do it themselves….just like a new born infant does from the time it is born!
-   The machines could then decide whether or not they like us…and if they should keep us around!
## Self Awareness in Popular Culture
-   Science Fiction from Asimov, Phillip Dick, Arthur Clarke, Brian Aldiss and others…
-   Robots
-   Malevolent Computers
-   Artificial Worlds
-   Androids and Replicants

-   Self Aware Machines the enslave mankind
## Asimov’s Robotics Laws
Over-riding Law: A robot may not injure humanity, or, through inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.  
Law One: A robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm, unless this would violate a higher order law.  
Law Two: A robot must obey orders given it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with a higher order law.  
Law Three: A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with a higher order law.  
[Isaac Asimov](http://inventors.about.com/gi/dynamic/offsite.htm?site=http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/books/isaac-asimov-faq/part3/faq.html)
Given the uncanny accuracy that science fiction has for predicting the future…who knows?…

"I have no hesitation in thinking  
that a machine can be just as intelligent and just as real as a person, in principle."
