## Wireless Media
- Infrared is good between fixed locations.  It is also not bothered by noise.
- Lasers are also excellent point to point systems with limited range 
- Radio frequency  networks are more flexible and allow the participants to be mobile and move while they communicate
## Wireless Networks
- Radio data networks are the fastest growing type of network technology today.
- This model is much like the terrestrial LANs we know and love except that it is total portable and works without cables and wall jacks!
## Types of Data Wireless
- WiFi (802.11b/g)  High speed wireless with range up to 200 feet or so.  Speeds up to 100mbps
- BlueTooth – Personal Area Network with range of up to 30 feet
- GPRS/3G/4G/5G – Wide area data network used in conjunction with cellular telephone services
- VSAT – Small antenna satellite technology used for high speed data communication over very large distances
## Mobile Wireless Networks aka…Cell Phones  

- Originally invented by Motorola in cooperation with AT&T in early 1970’s
- Huge increase in usage as a result of the rapid adoption of cellphones worldwide (> 2.5 Billion subscribers and growing at double digit rates)
- Two dominant cellphone technologies

- GSM (Global system for mobile communications) (80%)
- CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) (20%)
- Both technologies incorporate data along with voice and messaging
- The cellphone system would not be possible without very sophisticated computing systems to enable it
## The Original Cellphone 
Motorola Dynatac 8000X
Cost $100 Million to Develop
First phones cost over $4K !!  Motorola Dynatac
½ hour talk time
10 Hours to charge
-   Weighed almost 4 pounds
## Cell phone history trivia

- In 1978 AT&T commissioned Mackenzie research to project the market for cell phones in the U.S.
- Mackenzie estimated that the total market by the year 2000 would be 1 million units
- Today there are over 200 million cellphone subscribers in the U.S. alone and still growing
- Mackenzie’s research did not anticipate the precipitous drop in handset cost which would make cell phones popular with consumers as opposed to businesses alone

## 4th Generation and 5th Generation Wireless  
4G
-   4G is the current mobile wireless standard
-   10 times faster than 3G
-   5-15 Mbps download, peak 50 Mbps
-   Enables full motion video

5G
-   5G is the new emerging standard 
-   Still under deployment
-   Speeds over 1 Gbps!
-   Faster than typical cable connections
-   Initially deployed in Seoul, South Korea and now in the U.S.
## Satellite VSATs
Starlink is launching 40,000 Low earth satellites to provide Internet access from everywhere on earth
