## Factors behind the early development of the Internet
-   U.S. and Soviet Bloc engaged in a “cold war” escalating after WWII 
-   MAD Doctrine (Mutually Assured Destruction)
-   The U.S. Govt. did not have an adequate communications network to function effectively in the event of a real nuclear conflict with the USSRThe early funding from DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ) was an attempt to identify technologies that could be employed to create a “resilient” data network that could continue to function in the event of nuclear war 
## A Very  Short History of the Internet 
-   1961-69 Research in distributed communications progresses
-   1969 Arpanet (Advanced Research Projects Network) is commissioned by the Department of Defense with nodes at UCLA, Stanford Research, UC Santa Barbara and Univ. of Utah…designed as a “best effort” network
-   1971- 15 nodes operational w/ 23 Systems
-   1972- Email is introduced
-   1982- TCP/IP is chosen as the new communications protocol for Arpanet, developed by Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn, the ”fathers” of the internet

[Internet History of 1970s | Internet History | Computer History Museum](https://www.computerhistory.org/internethistory/1970s/)
## Earliest Internet Apps
The first application was a crude form of email which enabled researchers located at the various hosts to share text information electronically
This was soon followed by a file transfer application which allowed the sharing of medium sized text files
Next up was the establishment of “bulletin boards” which allowed groups of researchers to post message threads around topics of mutual interest…an early form of “blogging”
Also known as Newsgroups
## …very short Internet history
-   1984- Number of systems reaches 1000
-   1988- Chat introduced by Jakko Oikarenen
-   1989- Number of systems reaches 10,000
-   1990- Arpanet ceases to exist and is now known as the Internet as restrictions on commercial use are dropped by the Govt.
-   1991- Initial design for the World Wide Web is published by CERN, led by Tim Berners-Lee
-   1992 Number of systems reaches 1,000,000
-   1993 Pizza Hut puts up its first website from which you could theoretically order a pizza
## ..short history continued
-   1993-White House ( [www.whitehouse.gov](http://www.whitehouse.gov/) ) goes on-line-   1995-Netscape introduces the first real hypermedia browser as a result of research performed at U. of Minn. (Mosaic)-   1996-Microsoft introduces Internet Explorer and the browser wars begin-   1997-U.S. Commercial Decency act is passed, and promptly struck down by the Supreme Court as Unconstitutional
## …….and Finally!!!!!
2020 -4.2 Billion Active Internet Users
-   The Internet Protocol had become the world standard for networks and everything is being connected….computers, cellphones, pda’s, cable boxes, Playstations, cameras, doorbells, alarms, smoke detectors, etc, etcProbably the 2nd most important invention of the 20th Century! 
## Domain Statistics as of  
9 / 2020 
-   330,000,000 active domains
-      386,000,000 deleted domains
-        80,000 domains added in past 24 hours
-        93,000 domains deleted in past 24 hours
-        Over 2 Billion registered websites 
## So….What is the Internet? 
-   a loose confederation of data communication networks
-   “data communications”: sending digital information from computer to computer
-   “information highway” connecting far corners of the world
-   an open, distributed system: no central control
## Most Popular Internet Applications
 a variety of applications (software) for      sending and receiving information 
-   electronic mail (still numero uno)
-   file transfers (FTP)
-   World Wide Web (WWW)
-   Podcasting and streaming audio
-   Streaming Video
-   IM (Internet Relay Chat)
-   Video Conferencing
-   Voice over IP (VOIP)
-   Facebook, Google Apps, Twitter, Instagram, Games, and on and on…..
## Email  Stats
-   Approximately 170 Billion emails sent every day
-   70 percents of all emails are spam or infected with worms or viruses
-   1.1 Billion legitimate senders per day
(One out of every six people)
## Origins of the “Web”
-   Tim Berners-Lee and CERN project (1989)
-   First ever web page: [http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html)
-   Initially a distributed, hypertext system for disseminating physics and scientific research
-   Pages based on a markup language that can be shared by different computer systems
 
## World Wide Web
-   An assortment of computers (web servers) connected by the Internet
-   employs a common protocol (standard) HTTP (hyperText transfer protocol), basically “Text on Drugs”
-   Sending and receiving hypermedia documents
-   Hypertext pioneered at Brown!
-   [http://ei.cs.vt.edu/book/chap1/htx_hist.html](http://ei.cs.vt.edu/book/chap1/htx_hist.html)
 
## Early Years of the Web 
-   Text-based browsers
-   Web expands to government agencies and educational community
-   NCSA introduces a graphical user interface (GUI) browser, Mosaic (1993), followed by Netscape and Internet Explorer
-   Web becomes the new Internet “killer app”
Performance issues gave the web the name the “World Wide Wait” 
## Commercialization of the Web
-   Original ban on commercial sites lifted (1990)
-   “.com” becomes the most dominant origin designator as opposed to .edu, .gov, .org, .biz, etc;
-   e-commerce is born: electronic transactions over the Web (and Internet)
-   Over 1 Billion websites on line today
## Organization of the Web
-   Web clients (browsers) and Web servers
-   common protocol: HTTP
-   HyperText Transfer Protocol
-   (connect, request, send, receive, display)
-   Naming convention called URLs for identifying resources
-   HTML (HyperText Markup Language) defines how Web pages are structured
### Web Browsers & Servers
-   Web browsers (clients)
-   ask for, receive, and display Web documents
-   Web servers
-   remote systems that store Web documents
-   process client requests and send resources
### Hypermedia and Hyperlinks
-   electronic documents containing multimedia information
-   hyperlinks (“links”) to cross-reference pages and resources
-   links provide automatic access
-   hypermedia documents are “navigated” using these links

### Going to a Web Site
-   You are in a web browser and you ask to go to
 [www.cs.brown.edu/courses/cs](http://www.cs.brown.edu/courses/cs002/)ci0020             
(the home page for this course).  What happens?
-   The fast answer is, a page of information is transferred to your computer, which proceeds to display it.  The web page comes to you!!!
### Fetching & Opening Web Pages
-   Web browsers ask for pages by their  Uniform Resource Locator
http://www.cs.brown.edu/courses/cs002/
URLs provide a convenient and easy to remember naming
For a Web Site as opposed to its actual address
[http://192.168.125.1/](http://192.168.125.1/)  for instance
Parts of a URL
-   http://  This states that we a requesting a page from a remote web server.
-   www.cs.brown.edu This is the name of the web server.  This name must be “registered” with the powers that be.
-   /courses/cs002 indicates which of the many pages from that server is being requested.

## Protocols
-   There are many protocols that govern how information is transferred on the web.  A “protocol” is a convention established to govern the manner in which data traverses a network.
The “http” at the start of the URL stands for “Hypertext transfer protocol,” which is the main such protocol.
## Return Addresses
-   Your request is transferred to the right server because machines along the way (routers) know how to interpret the URL and map it to an address where the web page resides
-   When it arrives at the correct server, your message includes a “return address” so the server knows where to send the requested page.

## What is a Web Server?
   A “server” is simply a computer that acts as a utility for other computers.  A web server is a server that serves up web pages.  
A file server is a computer that returns files requested by users on other computers.  (When you request a file from the Brown computer system, you are communicating with a file server.) 
When the Information Arrives
-   When the web page you have requested arrives at your machine, your browser must figure out how to display it.
-   A browser (like IE6 or Netscape) is a piece of software that, among other things, translates the information received into a screen display.
  
## Search Engines
-   An internet search engine (like Yahoo or Google) is a program that tries to provide a user with a list of potentially relevant web sites based upon (typically) a few key words provided by the user.
-   The actual “search” is being done by a server (in this case a computer belonging to the search engine company).
## Search Engine Communication
-   To initiate a search your browser sends your keywords to the server.  
-   The server tries to match them against an index of key words along with addresses of possible web sites.  The URLs for the web sites are then sent back to your machine.      
The differences between search engines are their indexing and matching methods. 
## How Does it Work?
-   The short, short summary is that Google (and other search engines) continuously crawl the web, using a program called a spider or crawler.  
-   It stores a local copy of the pages it finds, and builds a lexicon of common words. For each word, it creates a list of pages that contain that word. 
-   A query for a given word returns that list, sorted by pagerank. Pagerank is computed based on the pageranks of the pages linking to a document.
## Making money on searches
 Google has become one of the most highly valued public companies in the world due to it’s popularity and its ability to get advertisers to bid on page ranking in order to feature their web links 
Evaluating Content on the Web
-   The web is an anarchist’s heaven.  There is little accountability for anything published there; for example:
-   No censorship
-   Accuracy of unverified information is always an issue since it is easy to remain anonymous
-   Much of the content is “rushed” into print
-   Information (true and false) on practically everything can be found there however and it is constantly evolving and being updated
## TCP/IP
-   Messages on the internet are standardized using two protocols:
-   TCP (Transfer Control Protocol) breaks messages up into small chunks.
-   IP (Internet Protocol) specifies how messages are addressed and routed.
### TCP
-   Messages are broken up into units of a fixed size and sent out on the internet.
-   These messages may be received in an order different from that in which they were sent.
-   Each packet contains a destination address
-   Individual packets may also be lost.
-   TCP may request packets to be resent, and finally it puts the units back in order.
### IP
-   The Internet Protocol governs addressing and routing.
-   An IP address is 4 numbers, each less than 256.  For example, 156.222.111.255
-   The routers on the web know how to interpret IP addresses and send the packets to the correct destination.
IP packets are also known as DATAGRAMS 
## The Internet uses Packet Switching
-   In packet switching, the message is broken up into separate data packets each addressed to the destination
-   Packets are transmitted over any available connection to the destination, where the receiving node reassembles the message
### Packet Errors
-   The Internet was designed to be a “best effort” network when it was conceived
-   Performance, Security and Reliability enhancements have been band aids on top of the original, simple design
-   Approximately 1-3 % of ALL packets sent over the Internet get lost and have to be re-transmitted
## Domain Names
-   Domain names are more intuitive names for IP addresses.  
-   The name cs.brown.edu is the domain name for the Brown computer science home page.
-   How is the connection made between the domain name and the IP address?
### Domain Name Servers
-   To some degree the process is distributed.  That is, Brown provides a name server for all domain names that end in brown.edu.
-   But how does the internet find the address of this name server?
-   There are top level name servers for each of the domains .com, .edu, etc.
### Top Level Domain Name Servers
-   When someone registers a .com domain name for instance, the registering company forwards this information to Network Solutions, the company that runs the primary top level domain name server for .com addresses.
-   They add this information to the name server that they run.
### Secondary Top Level Servers
-   Within 48 hours of the entry into the Network Solutions machine this information is copied over into several other top level servers. 
-   This relieves traffic on any one, and makes sure that one machine going down will not cripple the internet.
## Caching Servers
-   Caching servers are located at locations where there is a high degree of activity
-   They maintain copies of the most frequently accessed web pages so that they can be retrieved “locally” instead of having to go over the internet for each access.
-   This works for those web pages that don’t change very often
-   Most large businesses and institutions have local caching servers
-   Increases performance and reduces traffic
## How to Get Your Own .Com
-   Go to a domain registry like Go Daddy!
-   Register a unique name that is not already in use!
-   These days you can register a  domain name for about $25/year.
## Space…the Final Frontier
-   The Internet was designed to accommodate about 4 Billion unique addresses using the current address numbering scheme
-  Over 3.2 Billion addresses are already in use
-   Today, most domains and Internet Service Providers maintain tables of sub-addresses which are assigned to users when they connect in order to conserve addresses
-   This is very complicated and inefficient
-   Ideally, everyone and every device would have a unique address
## IPV6 has the answer!
Internet protocol Version 6 has been implemented which offers 
  
  340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456  addresses
  4 billion X 4 billion X 4 billion X 4 billion

Why is that important?
When fully implemented, everyone on the planet and every device that they own could have a unique internet address
Computers, PDAs, Cellphones, Media Players, Wrist watches, Appliances, Televisions, Radios, Automobiles…the list goes on…

## Information Overload!
the world's total yearly production of print, film, optical, and magnetic content would require roughly 1.5 billion gigabytes of storage. This is the equivalent of 250 megabytes per person for each man, woman, and child on earth*
What a physical model of it might look like
## Security Issues
-   The widespread adoption of the Internet and the Web and Email in particular, have made the net the breeding ground for many types of illicit or undesirable activities:
-   Computer Viruses, Trojans and Worms
-   Financial Fraud and Identity Theft    
-   Crimes against seniors, minors
-   Anonymous Libel
-   State sponsored Cyber warfare
## The Impact of the Internet
-   Very few technological advances have impacted the planet as quickly and as completely as the development of the Internet
-   No one involved in the early development would have envisaged the level of adoption or the range of services that today we take for granted
-   The Net continues to grow and evolve.
# Digital Networks
## Data Network Basics
![SocialNetworkAnalysis.png (5459×3529) (wikimedia.org)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/SocialNetworkAnalysis.png)
What is a Data Communications Network?
It is an infrastructure that contains connection nodes and transmission pathways which allow the reliable exchange of data between connected parties
## Underlying Trends in Networks Today
-   The industry has evolved from a multitude of proprietary standards to the wholesale adoption of widely accepted standards 
-   This has resulted in the ability of practically anyone to connect to the large public networks available without having to engage in special engineering
-   It has dramatically reduced the overall cost of deploying and operating networks
-   The industry has evolved from a multitude of proprietary standards to the wholesale adoption of widely accepted standards

## Shannon’s Data Communciation Model -- Six Components
-   An information source generates a message
-   A transmitter encodes the message as a signal
-   The signal is transmitted over a communications channel -- a medium that bridges the distance between the transmitter and the receiver
-   A source of noise is usually present in the communication channel -- this is a random element that modifies the encoded signal in unpredictable ways
-   The receiver extracts a signal from the communications channel and converts it back into the form of a message
-   The destination receives the message
## Shannon’s Model Illustrated
-   The six components of a data communications system:
![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/LFE_7SZtTKLA3v2iVThgomtq2xpWL2CCs-tnNDuYtjm0gK9zri9fhUyTShGWxrwlrIvD4qA6gr6S6YGKUTg4BoQdAn34bZo9mDZOSSfpFEqO5lymxsNqAaz9lybgC3wrgWymwyAAl2r_FH4=s2048)
## Transmitting and Receiving using Modems
-   In data communications, data may be transmitted as either analog or digital (discrete) signals
-   Analog signals are composed of waves
-   repeating waveforms are modulated (altered) to encode information
-   Digital data must be translated into modulated analog signals for transmission and the signal must be translated back into digital data at the receiver
Special devices called modems (modulate/demodulate) are used to perform these translations
## Modem Functionality
![fmmod](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/o_2jUg_9aMAL63ZvL8JHGIin7Zl7_c4VRnuzRD_U_FCH-wNQibidxXs3yjxC_kUoW_hmLoH4xALIubN_reEtwdnmnFoL_m7EPj6fsj3mxwcEsFH5IjQhgiClP6jsET4zwLo3vMRAe8sEr3k=s2048)

Frequency Modulation - The diagram shows how the carrier varies in frequency corresponding to the data being transmitted

## Noise
-   In the transmission of information errors are thought of as noise.
-   The term comes from the early days of radio, where the transmission errors literally resulted in a noisy radio broadcast.
-   Noise is viewed as a (typically) random process.
## Error Detection
Today’s communications systems usually incorporate error detection  
This is achieved by adding additional data to a message that is calculated by the sum of all the bits in the message
When a message is received the sum is recalculated and compared to the received message.  If it matches, no errors were present.
## Encoding Information
We encode analog information into digital for  four reasons:
-   We need to represent it somehow in binary
-   We may need to compress the message size.
-   We may need to protect privacy and security.
-   We may need to detect (and possibly correct) error caused by noise
## Channel Properties
-   Bandwidth - how much information can travel through it in a given amount of time.  We often measure this in megahertz, but more intuitively we use bits/second.
-   Latency, how long does it take to get from one end to another.
-   Signal to noise ratio (SNR).  The ratio of signal to noise expressed in decibels
## Properties of Networks
-   Distance (geographical size)
-   Media (what carries the messages)
-   Signal (how is the information passed through the media).
-   Switching (handling many users )
## Topology (the physical configuration of the network)
-   A local area network (or LAN) is typically confined to a single organization spread over a distance that can be easily walked.
-   A wide area network (or WAN) is typically serving multiple entities, and is spread much farther    
## An internet is a network that includes multiple LANs and WANs
We distinguish between bounded media (Often called Terrestrial) and wireless media..

Typical bounded media include
-   Twisted pair wire (about 10 megabits/sec)
-   Coaxial cable (about 50 megabits/sec)
-   FiberOptics (about 10 gigabit/sec)

Wireless media include:
- Radio 
- Infared
- Laser
## Switching
One needs to switch between the messages of various users.  Two basic method types:
-   Circuit switching - a connection is established between users until the message is complete. Your voice telephone works on this principle
- Packet switching - messages are broken up into packets and multiple messages and packets are being carried at the same time over different paths
## Packet Switching Example
![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/9GCAvzlxEtGpuLZpT-7F5KA9a5EtNLYwW6oQWMrvDyclsbouzshPhSHczxrVcqDRHOY9jzCH_1q235Pt8GljwrpTALB_l9LyViM7XSo5Qda2AE-91-teLXlWNnzyOVoBy9vbedLzCMsuBxY=s2048)
Local and Wide Area Networks
## Uses of LANs
Wide-area networks are primarily used for communication.  Local-area networks are also used for communication as well as resource sharing, including:
-   Printers
-   Computing and Web servers
-   File servers
## LAN Topology
The topology of a LAN is the way the computers are connected together.  There are several common configurations:
-   Star
-   Bus
-   Ring
## Network Topologies
![nettopoc](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/zY2LXfR6F7tQ5M4Ux_EOm_j6mEAcf6wQ8i7OF3Juwh8jNC7sI9P3Kcc4he04ZIPE7xpo6qAAM_g58y8qNAO9XOM8QCuFEGKXQ89polVevuxhbN4DGp4H6js8ipldsrU_aTlohZqFnKFyrcE=s2048)
## Ethernet Switching
-   Ethernets use bus or ring topologies. 
-   To send a message, wait for an idle moment and send it.
-   All machines constantly listen to the network for messages addressed to them.
-   If someone else picks the same moment to send we have packet collision.
## Ethernet Packet Collision
-   Should packet collision occurs, both parties must re-send
-   But they must choose the moment randomly, or else they will re-collide
-   Packet collision limits the number of messages that can be send on ethernet LANs and determines the variable latency experienced by the users
## Ethernet Bus
## Complicated LANs
-   LANs tend to grow.  The Brown computer science LAN now has about 250 machines attached to it.
-   To handle this sort of traffic (and reduce the number of collisions) the LAN has been broken up into several sub-LANs.
Sub-LANs can be connected by switches and routers
## Switches and Routers
-   Both bridges and routers allow messages to pass between one sub-LAN and another.
-   A bridge simply notes if the recipient of the message is in the other LAN, and if so, allows the message to cross over.
-   A router is used when there is more than one way to route the messag and must be used to access the   internet WAN
## Interconnected Lans
## Symmetry
-   Symmetric Networks are those where the data in both directions is more or less the same.  
-   Asymmetric networks are characterized by a large difference between data in one direction vs. the other……Web Traffic, File Transfers(FTPs), etc.
Hubs, Switches and Routers?
-   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1z0ULvg_pW8
## Intranets
-   An Intranet is a closed network that has group of defined users 
-   (Intra-organizational)
-   Intranets exist for businesses, universities, trade organizations, etc.
-   Most Intranets are also connected to the Internet
## Network Nodes
-   Nodes are a location on a network where there is an aggregation of connections
-   Internet nodes are also those places where many smaller networks are actually connected to the Internet

## Digital Subscriber Loop - DSL
Allows high speed data to share the same wires as regular voice telephone service.
Developed for consumer internet access as an alternative to dialup
![dsl-network](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/qBV56Nn8QJ4OQeGXhIDxfRabIooc_XkM5BkuV6fRuJBvMKfZL9jnXGCL5Btw4rqX-d5I3i5JHAvnU49nb6zHKFZ-je6B5IM2kLPkKJzyy6JmbdM___yDlKnxrau2nrWDXNB3Rv-VRmQ9fKY=s2048)
## Voice and Video over IP (VOIP)
-   VoIP is a technology that allows telephone calls to be made over computer networks like the Internet. VoIP converts analog voice signals into digital data packets and supports real-time, two-way transmission of conversations using the [Internet Protocol (IP)](http://compnetworking.about.com/library/glossary/bldef-ip.htm)
-   Skype, Vonage, Ooma, WhatsApp, Facetime Zoom, etc:
