Challenges to Continuation of Moore’s Law
-   The thickness (in atoms) between the silicon layers in transistors is getting very thin as we attempt to cram more transistors into the same amount of space…so much so that new materials need to be developed
-   HEAT!!  As we put more and more transistors on a chip, the ability to cool it and keep it from burning up is increasingly a problem
-   Noise -  As more transistors are packed ever more tightly together, the noise level of the circuits increases which affects reliability
## Quad Core Processor
4 CPUs on one chip….. One way to increase performance…
## Parallel Processing
# A New Computing Paradigm?
-   Quantum Computing 
-   Seeks to use the “spin” of atomic particles to implement binary digital systems
-   Molecular computing
-   Using molecules to hold electrical charges instead of using transistors
-   Very much in primary research….not here yet
