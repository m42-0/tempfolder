Where are parallel busses used?

  

-   All of the paths inside the CPU and between the CPU, main memory and video processor are implemented using parallel busses for the very fastest transfer rates.
    

-   Any plug in cards use parallel busses as well as internal magnetic and optical disk drives.
    

  

-   Most of these busses are either 16, 32 or 64 bits wide
    






Where are serial busses used?

  

-   Serial busses are primarily used to connect external devices and peripherals.  The data transfer rates of peripherals connected via serial are generally slower than those connected by parallel.
    

  

-   Serial is convenient, relatively inexpensive and getting faster all of the time.
    

  

-   The current serial standard for peripherals is called USB 2.0 and USB 3.0
    




USB 2.0

  

-   Max transfer speed of 400Mbps (Megabits per second), 40 times faster than the predecessor USB 1.1
    

  

-   Supports up to 127 devices connected to the same controller chip!
    

  

-   A USB cable can be 5 meters long without causing any performance problems
    

  

-   USB has become the ubiquitous serial connection standard for practically every external PC peripheral
    




USB 3.0!

  

-   Standard introduced in 2008
    

  

-   Up to 5 Gigabits per second!
    

  

-   10 times faster than USB 2.0
    




USB 4.0

  
  

-   Introduced at the end of 2020
    

  

        Up to 40GBps!






Apple’s Thunderbolt

  

-   “The most advanced I/O EVER!”  per Apple
    
-   Supports high resolution video and high performance data transfers through a SINGLE compact port
    

  

-   Up to 20 Gb/sec transfer speed!
    
-   40 times faster that USB 2 and 4 time faster than USB 3.   Compatible with USB 4.0

Clocking Data on the Bus

  

-   Both serial and parallel busses transfer data using a clock signal that ensures that data is sent and received at certain times based on the clock speed.  
    

  

-   Without the clock, data transfers would be less reliable given the variation in cable length and other environmental factors

Wireless I/O

  

-   Wifi:  Wireless local area network (LAN) technology that uses Internet Protocol to transfer data between devices.  Latest generation (n) operates at >100 megabits/second and has an indoor range of about 150 ft.
    

  

-   Bluetooth:  Personal area network (PAN) Very low power with range of <20 ft in most applications and speeds of 80 kilobits/second
