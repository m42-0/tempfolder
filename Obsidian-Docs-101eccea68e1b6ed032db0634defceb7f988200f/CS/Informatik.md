# Just Some of the Companies that defined the Personal Computer Business early on
-   Xerox
    
-   IBM
    
-   Commodore
    
-   Texas Instrument
    
-   Osborne
    
-   MITS
    
-   AT&T
    
-   Compaq
    

-   Toshiba

-   Apple
    
-   Microsoft
    
-   South West Technical Prod.
    

-   Over 4 Billion operations per second costs less than $300
    

  

-   Memory is measured in Gigabytes….not Megabytes, Kilobytes
    

  

-   Storage is Terabytes, soon to be Petabytes
    

  

-   Communications speeds are measured in Megabits/Gigabits per second, not Kilobits
    

  

-   And so it continues !!!
    



-   All of the personal computing devices that we use and enjoy today are a direct result of the ability year over year to reduce size, cost and energy consumption while at the same time increasing computer power.
    

  

-   The trend continues, but due to physics limitations Moore’s law is starting to slow down.  We may have to consider changing the fundamental building blocks from silicon based transistors to another technology.

#  The Rise of the Internet
## Factors behind the early development of the Internet


**

-   U.S. and Soviet Bloc engaged in a “cold war” escalating after WWII 
    

-   MAD Doctrine (Mutually Assured Destruction)
    

  

-   The U.S. Govt. did not have an adequate communications network to function effectively in the event of a real nuclear conflict with the USSR
    

  
The early funding from DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ) was an attempt to identify technologies that could be employed to create a “resilient” data network that could continue to function in the event of nuclear war**


  **A Very  Short History of the Internet**

-   1961-69 Research in distributed communications progresses
    
-   1969 Arpanet (Advanced Research Projects Network) is commissioned by the Department of Defense with nodes at UCLA, Stanford Research, UC Santa Barbara and Univ. of Utah…designed as a “best effort” network
    

  

-   1971- 15 nodes operational w/ 23 Systems
    

  

-   1972- Email is introduced
    

  

-   1982- TCP/IP is chosen as the new communications protocol for Arpanet, developed by Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn, the ”fathers” of the internet**

**The Original Internet 1969**
