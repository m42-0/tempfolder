U.S. and Soviet Bloc engaged in a cold war escalating after WWII

MAD Doctrine

The U.S. Govt. did not have  adequate communications network to function effectively in the event of a real nuclear conflict with the USSR 

DARPA (Defense Advaned Research Projects Agency)
create a "resilient" data network that could continue to function in the event of nuclear war 


1961-69 REsearch in distributed communications progresses 

1969 Arpanet
differenent nodes around U.S. , designed as a "best effort" network 

1971
15 nodes operational with 23 Systems

1972
Email is introduced

1982
TCP/IP is chosen as the new communications protocal for Arpanet, developed by Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn, 
the "fathers" ot the internet

First Application

- crude form of email
- file transfer
- bulletin boards

2020 
4.2 b. Active Internet Users
IP Protocol had become the standard for networks and everything is being connected

Domain Statistics

Domain is a adress registered with an assigned IP address 

330 mio active domains
386 mio deleted domains

80k domains added in past 24 hours
93k domains deleted in past 24 hours

Over 2 Billion registered websites:
Many people registered domain names for the purpose of reselling them to the companies whose names were registered. "Domain Name Blackmail"

Internet? 

- A loose confederation of data communication networks 
- Messages from clients in the same network never(?) leave the internal network
- "data communications": sending digital information from computer to computer
- "information highway"
- an open, distributed system: no central control 
- multiple paths for message to get digital messages from computer to computer

Internet is the infrastructure. A variety of software for sending and receiving information exists:

- electronic mail
- file transfer (ftp)
- world wide web (www)
- Podcasting and streaming audio
- Streaming Video
- IM (Internet Relay Chat)
- Video Conferencing
- Voice over IP (VOIP)
- Games, Social Media, Cloud Apps etc

Email Stats

Approx 170b emails sent every day
70% of them are infected with worms or viruses
1.1b legitimate senders per day (one out of every six people)

Phishing:
cheap to send many emails. quantity of emails gets some catches. 

Origins of the "Web"

Initially a distributed, hypertext system for disseminating physics and scientifig research

Pages based on markup language (HTML), which cdan be shared by different computer systems

World Wide Web

An assortment of comuters (web servers) connected by the Internet
employs a common protocol (standard) HTTP "Text on Drugs"
Sending and receiving hypermedia documents


Early Years of the Web

- Text based browsers
- Web expands to goverment agencies and educational community 
- NCSA introduces a GUI browser Mosaic, followed by Netscape and IE
- Web becomes the new internet "killer app"
- "World Wide Wait"

Commercialization of the WEb

- Original ban on commercial sites lifted 1990
- ".com" most dominant origin designator
- e-commerce is born: electronic transactions over the Web (and Internet)
- Over 1 Billion websites on-line today

Organization of the Web

- Client/Server
- HyperText Transfer Protocol (connect,request,send,receive,display)
- URL for identifying resources
- HyperText Markup Language structures a web-page

Web Browsers & Servers

Web browsers (clients)
ask for, receive, and display Web documents

Web servers
remote systems that store Web documents
process client requests and send resources


Hypermedia and Hyperlinks

electronic documents containing multimedia information

hyperlinks ("links") to cross-reference pages and resources

links provide automatic access

hypermedia documents are navigated using links


Fetching & Opening Web Pages

- Web browsers ask for pages by their Uniform Resource Locator 
http://www.1232323.lol

Dictionary which maps all web addresses to physical addresses 


URL 

--protocol--path--resources
http:// test.lol.com /resources


Protocols 
 convention established to govern the manner in which data traverses a network

Return Addresses 

your request is transferred to the right server because machines along the way know how to interpret the URL and map it to an address where the web page resides

When it arrives at the correct server, yxour message includes a "return address" so the server knows where to send the requested page


Web Server?

A Computer that acts as utility for other computers. It "serves" up web pages

A file server is a computer that returns files requested by users on other computers

When the web page you have requested arrives at your machine , your browser will interpret and translate the information received into a screen display 

Search Engines

a program that returns a list of relevant web sites based upon a few key words provided by the user
The search is done by a server 

Client sends keywords to server
Server tries to match them against an index of keywords along with possible addresses of web sites. The URLs are sent back to client

The difference between search engines are their indexing and matching methods


Crawlers 
continuously crawl the web 

it stores a local copy of the pages it finds, and builds a lexicon of common words. For each word, it creates a list of pages that contain that word. 

A query for a given word returns that list, sorted by pagerank. Pagerank is computed based on the pageranks of the pages linking to a document

Evaluating Content on the Web

The 

TCP/IP

Transfer Control Protocol 
breaks messages up into small chunks

Internet Protocol specifies how messages are addressed and routed. 

Messages are broken up into units of a fixed size (packets/datagrams)
Messages may be received in a different order from that in which they where sent
Each packet contains a destination address
Individual packets may also be lost
TCP may request packets to be resent 

IP

4 numbers, each less than 256

gets routed to the correct destination


The Internet uses Packet Switching

messages are broken up into seperate data packets 
packets are transmitted over any available conenction to the destination, where the receiving node reassembles the message (sequence numbers)

Packet Errors

The internet was designed to be a "best effort" network 
Performance, Security and Reliabilit enhancements have been band aids on top of the original, simple design
Approximately 1-3% of ALL packets sent over the Internet get lost and have to be re-transmitted

Domain Names
are intuitiv names for IP addresses(Phone book for the internet)
How is the connection made between domain name and IP?

Domain Name Servers

distributed to some degree (Brown provides a name server for all domain names that end in brown.edu)

Top Level Name servers 
for each of the domains .com, .edu, .org ... 

When someone registers a .com domain, the registering company forwards this information to Network Solutions, the company that runs the primary top level domain name server for .com addresses

Secondary Top Level Servers

Within 48 hours of the entry to Network Solutions machine, this information is copied over into several other top level servers

This relieves traffic on any one, and makes sure that one machine going down will no cripple the internet 

Caching Servers
are located at locations where ther is a high degree of activity 
They maintain copies of the most frequently accessed web pages so that they can be retrieved "locally" instead of having to go over the internet for each access
best for static pages, increases performance and reduces traffic 

Space... The Final Frontier

The Internet was designed to accommodate about 4b unique addresses with 4 numbers scheme

IPV6

offers ......................................................... addresses 

4 billion x 4 billion x 4 billion x 4 billion 

Everything can have its own unique IP address 

Information Overload

The worlds total yearly production of print, film, optical, and magnetic conctent would require roughly 1.5b GB of storage. 

Security Issues

- Computer Viruses, Trojans and Worms
- Financial Fraud and Identity Theft
- Crimes against seniors, minors
- Anonymous Libel
- State sponsored Cyber warfare

The Uber Stack

"Digital"

Digital means discrete.
limited number of data points to encode information
most of our electronic devices use digital techniques to work with data and information
since we have a lmited number of data points to work with, it means that manyx representations are approximations of the real thing 

Analog is continous, digital is discrete 

More Samples = more accuracy
Tradeoff between accuracy and size 

Analog Signal (nature) into discrete values (binary,digital) 

Bits 

=Binary Digits

All Data in digital devices are contained in memory locations that are either on or off

8 bits = 256 values

BIT = single 1/0 position
Nibble = 4 BITS
BYTE = 8 BITS
WORD = MULTIPLE OF BYTES (16,32,48,64 bits Words)

Kilo = 1000
Mega = Millions
Gigy = Billions
Tera = Trillions
Peta = 1000 Trillion 
Exa = Million Trillion

Binary Arithmetic useful because of cheap production cost of transistors 


DIGITAL AUDIO

Introduction to Sound

Sounds are vibrations that travel through the air or some other medium

A sound wave is an audivle vibration that travels through air or water

The loudness or intensity of a sound is measured in Decibels (dB)

The frequency of sound is measured in Hertz (Hz)
