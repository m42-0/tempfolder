![star.jpg (300×376) (digibarn.com)](https://www.digibarn.com/collections/systems/xerox-8010/star.jpg)

-   Many of the innovations that became part of the Personal Computer scene were actually invented at XEROX Parc (Palo Alto Research Center)
    
-   Xerox was never able to successfully exploit those innovations that included the mouse, graphic user interface and the concept of WYSIWYG,
    (What you see is what you get)

# Just Some of the Companies that defined the Personal Computer Business early on
-   Xerox
    
-   IBM
    
-   Commodore
    
-   Texas Instrument
    
-   Osborne
    
-   MITS
    
-   AT&T
    
-   Compaq
    

-   Toshiba
    
-   Hitachi
    
-   Sinclair
    
-   Hewlett Packard
    
-   Sony
    
-   Apple
    
-   Microsoft
    
-   South West Technical Prod.
    

-   Over 4 Billion operations per second costs less than $300
    

  

-   Memory is measured in Gigabytes….not Megabytes, Kilobytes
    

  

-   Storage is Terabytes, soon to be Petabytes
    

  

-   Communications speeds are measured in Megabits/Gigabits per second, not Kilobits
    

  

-   And so it continues !!!
    



-   All of the personal computing devices that we use and enjoy today are a direct result of the ability year over year to reduce size, cost and energy consumption while at the same time increasing computer power.
    

  

-   The trend continues, but due to physics limitations Moore’s law is starting to slow down.  We may have to consider changing the fundamental building blocks from silicon based transistors to another technology.

#  The Rise of the Internet
## Factors behind the early development of the Internet

-   U.S. and Soviet Bloc engaged in a “cold war” escalating after WWII 
    
-   MAD Doctrine (Mutually Assured Destruction)

-   The U.S. Govt. did not have an adequate communications network to function effectively in the event of a real nuclear conflict with the USSR

  
The early funding from DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ) was an attempt to identify technologies that could be employed to create a “resilient” data network that could continue to function in the event of nuclear war 

## A Very  Short History of the Internet 

-   1961-69 Research in distributed communications progresses
    
-   1969 Arpanet (Advanced Research Projects Network) is commissioned by the Department of Defense with nodes at UCLA, Stanford Research, UC Santa Barbara and Univ. of Utah…designed as a “best effort” network
    
-   1971- 15 nodes operational w/ 23 Systems
    
-   1972- Email is introduced
    
-   1982- TCP/IP is chosen as the new communications protocol for Arpanet, developed by Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn, the ”fathers” of the internet 

## The Original Internet 1969

[Internet History of 1970s | Internet History | Computer History Museum](https://www.computerhistory.org/internethistory/1970s/)

## Earliest Internet Apps

The first application was a crude form of email which enabled researchers located at the various hosts to share text information electronically

This was soon followed by a file transfer application which allowed the sharing of medium sized text files

Next up was the establishment of “bulletin boards” which allowed groups of researchers to post message threads around topics of mutual interest…an early form of “blogging”

Also known as Newsgroups

## …very short Internet history
-   1984- Number of systems reaches 1000
    
-   1988- Chat introduced by Jakko Oikarenen
    
-   1989- Number of systems reaches 10,000
    
-   1990- Arpanet ceases to exist and is now known as the Internet as restrictions on commercial use are dropped by the Govt.
    
-   1991- Initial design for the World Wide Web is published by CERN, led by Tim Berners-Lee
    
-   1992 Number of systems reaches 1,000,000
    
-   1993 Pizza Hut puts up its first website from which you could theoretically order a pizza
    

## ..short history continued

-   1993-White House ( [www.whitehouse.gov](http://www.whitehouse.gov/) ) goes on-line
    

  

-   1995-Netscape introduces the first real hypermedia browser as a result of research performed at U. of Minn. (Mosaic)
    

  

-   1996-Microsoft introduces Internet Explorer and the browser wars begin
    

  

-   1997-U.S. Commercial Decency act is passed, and promptly struck down by the Supreme Court as Unconstitutional
    

 

## …….and Finally!!!!!

2020 -4.2 Billion Active Internet Users

-   The Internet Protocol had become the world standard for networks and everything is being connected….computers, cellphones, pda’s, cable boxes, Playstations, cameras, doorbells, alarms, smoke detectors, etc, etc
    

  
Probably the 2nd most important invention of the 20th Century! 


## Domain Statistics as of  
9 / 2020 

 

-   330,000,000 active domains
    

  

-      386,000,000 deleted domains
    

-        80,000 domains added in past 24 hours
    
-        93,000 domains deleted in past 24 hours
    
-        Over 2 Billion registered websites 


## So….What is the Internet? 

 

-   a loose confederation of data communication networks
    

  

-   “data communications”: sending digital information from computer to computer
    

  

-   “information highway” connecting far corners of the world
    

  

-   an open, distributed system: no central control
    

 
## Most Popular Internet Applications

 
  a variety of applications (software) for      sending and receiving information 

 

-   electronic mail (still numero uno)
    
-   file transfers (FTP)
    
-   World Wide Web (WWW)
    
-   Podcasting and streaming audio
    
-   Streaming Video
    
-   IM (Internet Relay Chat)
    
-   Video Conferencing
    
-   Voice over IP (VOIP)
    
-   Facebook, Google Apps, Twitter, Instagram, Games, and on and on…..
    

## Email  Stats

 

 

-   Approximately 170 Billion emails sent every day
    

  

-   70 percents of all emails are spam or infected with worms or viruses
    

  

-   1.1 Billion legitimate senders per day
    

(One out of every six people)

## Origins of the “Web”

 
 

-   Tim Berners-Lee and CERN project (1989)
    

  

-   First ever web page: [http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html)
    

  

-   Initially a distributed, hypertext system for disseminating physics and scientific research
    

  

-   Pages based on a markup language that can be shared by different computer systems
    

 

 
## World Wide Web

 

 

-   An assortment of computers (web servers) connected by the Internet
    

  

-   employs a common protocol (standard) HTTP (hyperText transfer protocol), basically “Text on Drugs”
    

  

-   Sending and receiving hypermedia documents
    

  

-   Hypertext pioneered at Brown!
    

-   [http://ei.cs.vt.edu/book/chap1/htx_hist.html](http://ei.cs.vt.edu/book/chap1/htx_hist.html)
    



 
## Early Years of the Web 

 

-   Text-based browsers
    

  

-   Web expands to government agencies and educational community
    

  

-   NCSA introduces a graphical user interface (GUI) browser, Mosaic (1993), followed by Netscape and Internet Explorer
    

  

-   Web becomes the new Internet “killer app”
    

  
Performance issues gave the web the name the “World Wide Wait” 

 

## Commercialization of the Web

 
 

-   Original ban on commercial sites lifted (1990)
    

  

-   “.com” becomes the most dominant origin designator as opposed to .edu, .gov, .org, .biz, etc;
-   e-commerce is born: electronic transactions over the Web (and Internet)
-   Over 1 Billion websites on line today

## Organization of the Web
-   Web clients (browsers) and Web servers
-   common protocol: HTTP
-   HyperText Transfer Protocol
-   (connect, request, send, receive, display)
-   Naming convention called URLs for identifying resources
-   HTML (HyperText Markup Language) defines how Web pages are structured

### Web Browsers & Servers
-   Web browsers (clients)
    

-   ask for, receive, and display Web documents
    

  

-   Web servers
    

-   remote systems that store Web documents
    
-   process client requests and send resources
    

### Hypermedia and Hyperlinks
-   electronic documents containing multimedia information
    
-   hyperlinks (“links”) to cross-reference pages and resources
    
-   links provide automatic access
    
-   hypermedia documents are “navigated” using these links
    

### Going to a Web Site
-   You are in a web browser and you ask to go to
    

 [www.cs.brown.edu/courses/cs](http://www.cs.brown.edu/courses/cs002/)ci0020             

(the home page for this course).  What happens?
-   The fast answer is, a page of information is transferred to your computer, which proceeds to display it.  The web page comes to you!!!
    
### Fetching & Opening Web Pages
-   Web browsers ask for pages by their  Uniform Resource Locator
    
http://www.cs.brown.edu/courses/cs002/
URLs provide a convenient and easy to remember naming

For a Web Site as opposed to its actual address
[http://192.168.125.1/](http://192.168.125.1/)  for instance
Parts of a URL
-   http://  This states that we a requesting a page from a remote web server.
    

-   www.cs.brown.edu This is the name of the web server.  This name must be “registered” with the powers that be.
    

-   /courses/cs002 indicates which of the many pages from that server is being requested.
    

## Protocols

-   There are many protocols that govern how information is transferred on the web.  A “protocol” is a convention established to govern the manner in which data traverses a network.
    
 
The “http” at the start of the URL stands for “Hypertext transfer protocol,” which is the main such protocol.

## Return Addresses

-   Your request is transferred to the right server because machines along the way (routers) know how to interpret the URL and map it to an address where the web page resides
    

-   When it arrives at the correct server, your message includes a “return address” so the server knows where to send the requested page.
    

## What is a Web Server?
   A “server” is simply a computer that acts as a utility for other computers.  A web server is a server that serves up web pages.  
    
 
A file server is a computer that returns files requested by users on other computers.  (When you request a file from the Brown computer system, you are communicating with a file server.) 

When the Information Arrives

-   When the web page you have requested arrives at your machine, your browser must figure out how to display it.
    

-   A browser (like IE6 or Netscape) is a piece of software that, among other things, translates the information received into a screen display.
    
## Search Engines
-   An internet search engine (like Yahoo or Google) is a program that tries to provide a user with a list of potentially relevant web sites based upon (typically) a few key words provided by the user.
    

-   The actual “search” is being done by a server (in this case a computer belonging to the search engine company).
    

## Search Engine Communication

-   To initiate a search your browser sends your keywords to the server.  
    

-   The server tries to match them against an index of key words along with addresses of possible web sites.  The URLs for the web sites are then sent back to your machine.  
    

The differences between search engines are their indexing and matching methods. 

## How Does it Work?

-   The short, short summary is that Google (and other search engines) continuously crawl the web, using a program called a spider or crawler.  
    

-   It stores a local copy of the pages it finds, and builds a lexicon of common words. For each word, it creates a list of pages that contain that word. 
    

-   A query for a given word returns that list, sorted by pagerank. Pagerank is computed based on the pageranks of the pages linking to a document.
    

## Making money on searches

 Google has become one of the most highly valued public companies in the world due to it’s popularity and its ability to get advertisers to bid on page ranking in order to feature their web links 


Evaluating Content on the Web

-   The web is an anarchist’s heaven.  There is little accountability for anything published there; for example:
    

-   No censorship
    

-   Accuracy of unverified information is always an issue since it is easy to remain anonymous
    

-   Much of the content is “rushed” into print
    

-   Information (true and false) on practically everything can be found there however and it is constantly evolving and being updated
    

## TCP/IP

-   Messages on the internet are standardized using two protocols:
    
-   TCP (Transfer Control Protocol) breaks messages up into small chunks.
    
-   IP (Internet Protocol) specifies how messages are addressed and routed.
    

### TCP

-   Messages are broken up into units of a fixed size and sent out on the internet.
    
-   These messages may be received in an order different from that in which they were sent.
    
-   Each packet contains a destination address
    
-   Individual packets may also be lost.
    
-   TCP may request packets to be resent, and finally it puts the units back in order.
    

### IP

-   The Internet Protocol governs addressing and routing.
    

-   An IP address is 4 numbers, each less than 256.  For example, 156.222.111.255
    

-   The routers on the web know how to interpret IP addresses and send the packets to the correct destination.
    
  
IP packets are also known as DATAGRAMS 

## The Internet uses Packet Switching

-   In packet switching, the message is broken up into separate data packets each addressed to the destination
    
-   Packets are transmitted over any available connection to the destination, where the receiving node reassembles the message
    

### Packet Errors

-   The Internet was designed to be a “best effort” network when it was conceived
    

-   Performance, Security and Reliability enhancements have been band aids on top of the original, simple design
    

-   Approximately 1-3 % of ALL packets sent over the Internet get lost and have to be re-transmitted
    

## Domain Names

-   Domain names are more intuitive names for IP addresses.  
    

-   The name cs.brown.edu is the domain name for the Brown computer science home page.
    

-   How is the connection made between the domain name and the IP address?
    

### Domain Name Servers

-   To some degree the process is distributed.  That is, Brown provides a name server for all domain names that end in brown.edu.
    

-   But how does the internet find the address of this name server?
    

-   There are top level name servers for each of the domains .com, .edu, etc.
    

### Top Level Domain Name Servers

-   When someone registers a .com domain name for instance, the registering company forwards this information to Network Solutions, the company that runs the primary top level domain name server for .com addresses.
    

-   They add this information to the name server that they run.
    

### Secondary Top Level Servers

-   Within 48 hours of the entry into the Network Solutions machine this information is copied over into several other top level servers. 

-   This relieves traffic on any one, and makes sure that one machine going down will not cripple the internet.
    

## Caching Servers

-   Caching servers are located at locations where there is a high degree of activity
    

-   They maintain copies of the most frequently accessed web pages so that they can be retrieved “locally” instead of having to go over the internet for each access
    

-   This works for those web pages that don’t change very often
    

-   Most large businesses and institutions have local caching servers
    
-   Increases performance and reduces traffic
    

## How to Get Your Own .Com
-   Go to a domain registry like Go Daddy!
    

-   Register a unique name that is not already in use!
    

-   These days you can register a  domain name for about $25/year.
    

## Space…the Final Frontier

-   The Internet was designed to accommodate about 4 Billion unique addresses using the current address numbering scheme
    

  

-  Over 3.2 Billion addresses are already in use
    

-   Today, most domains and Internet Service Providers maintain tables of sub-addresses which are assigned to users when they connect in order to conserve addresses
    

-   This is very complicated and inefficient
    

-   Ideally, everyone and every device would have a unique address
    

## IPV6 has the answer!

Internet protocol Version 6 has been implemented which offers 

  

  340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456  

  addresses

  

4 billion X 4 billion X 4 billion X 4 billion

How many is that?

Why is that important?

When fully implemented, everyone on the planet and every device that they own could have a unique internet address

Computers, PDAs, Cellphones, Media Players, Wrist watches, Appliances, Televisions, Radios, Automobiles…the list goes on…

![54136cf869bedd5d4f579825 (1200×737) (insider.com)](https://i.insider.com/54136cf869bedd5d4f579825?width=1200format=jpeg&auto=webp)

## Information Overload!
the world's total yearly production of print, film, optical, and magnetic content would require roughly 1.5 billion gigabytes of storage. This is the equivalent of 250 megabytes per person for each man, woman, and child on earth*
What a physical model of it might look like

## Security Issues

-   The widespread adoption of the Internet and the Web and Email in particular, have made the net the breeding ground for many types of illicit or undesirable activities:
    

-   Computer Viruses, Trojans and Worms
    
-   Financial Fraud and Identity Theft
    
-   Crimes against seniors, minors
    
-   Anonymous Libel
    
-   State sponsored Cyber warfare
    

## The Impact of the Internet

-   Very few technological advances have impacted the planet as quickly and as completely as the development of the Internet
    

-   No one involved in the early development would have envisaged the level of adoption or the range of services that today we take for granted.
    

-   The Net continues to grow and evolve.
    





-   DIGITAL - Digital means discrete.  
    

  

-   Digital representation is comprised of a limited number of data points to encode information. 
    

  

-   Most of our electronic devices use Digital techniques to work with data and information
    

  
Since we have a limited number of data points to work with, it means that many representations are approximations of the real thing




Analog vs. Digital





Analog is continuous, Digital is discrete



The difference between “analog” and “digital”




Analog vs Digital





Discrete Digital Sampling of an Analog Event





Bits ( = Binary Digits)



-   Internally, all data in a digital device is contained in memory locations that are either on or off.  
    

  

-   Thus everything in memory can be thought of as being expressed in “bits”,  aka “binary digits”
    

where on = 1 and off = 0

a single “bit” can represent only 2 values,

  
              0   or   1

Binary numbers



-   Obviously with 1 bit we can only represent two values  0 and 1
    

  

-   With 2 bits we can represent four different values: 
    

00, 01, 10, 11

  

-   With 8 bits (otherwise known as a  byte) we can represent 256 values 
    

( 0-255)





Nomenclature





-   A BIT is a single  1 / 0 position
    

  

-   A NIBBLE is 4 BITS
    

  

-   A BYTE is 8 BITS
    

  

-   A WORD is a multiple of BYTES eg: 16 bits, 32 bits, 48 bits, 64bits……….
    

  
Common nomenclature today is to define memory storage and data capacity in BYTES



More Nomenclature





-   As computers have become capable of processing and storing more data, we have coined:
    
-   KiloBytes  (Thousands)
    
-   MegaBytes (Millions)
    
-   GigaBytes  (Billions)
    
-   TeraBytes  (Trillions) –Library of Congress 30Tb
    
-   PetaByte (1000 Trillion)
    

ExaByte (Million Trillion)

Base 2 (Binary) vs. Decimal Comparison

            105           104          103         102       101       100

   10n =     100,000      10,000     1000     100        10          1

  
  

                        27        26       25        24        23       22       21      20

  
   2n =              128     64       32        16         8       4        2       1




Representing Data in the Computer




-   Internally, everything--data, programs, text, you name it--is represented in bits.
    
-   With an array of bits, we can represent any number or, thru assignment, any character so, for example:
    

  

-     0011 0000 = decimal 48 =  “H”
    

  
(256 combinations, 0 to 255)

How could we represent letters for instance?



For characters we need 26 letters, 10 numbers, special marks, etc.  About 127 possibilities including upper and lower case and control characters

  

Unicode is an agreed upon code in which every character, numbers, etc. is given a unique 8 bit code (1 byte).  

So we need 4 bytes to represent the word “love”

Remember, everything is represented in bits!



-   2 Bits – 00, 01, 10, 11 
    
-   3 Bits – 
    
-   4 Bits-
    
-   .
    
-   .
    
-   8 Bits- 
    
-   16 Bits-
    
-   24 Bits-
    




-   4 values
    
-   8 values
    
-   16 values
    

  
  

-   256 Values
    
-   65,536 Values
    
-   16,777,216 Values

How We Interact with Computers




Digital Components





“Digital”





-   DIGITAL - Digital means discrete.  
    

  

-   Digital representation is comprised of a limited number of data points to encode information. 
    

  

-   Most of our electronic devices use Digital techniques to work with data and information
    

  
Since we have a limited number of data points to work with, it means that many representations are approximations of the real thing

	 




What are computers made of?






-   Primarily Transistors
    

  

-   Invented in 1951, the Transistor is the basic electrical building block for all modern electronics
    

  

-   “the greatest invention of the 20th century”
    

  

-   For Digital applications, transistors are packaged in what is known as Integrated Circuits (ICs)
    

  

-   As many as 30+ Billion Transistors can be packaged in a single large  IC today
    





Anatomy of a Transistor





-   Transistors are fabricated using silicon (derived from quartz) and tiny amounts of impurities such as selenium or gallium arsenide to create what is called a “semiconductor”
    

  

-   Semiconductors allow us to control the flow of electrical charge (electrons) very precisely.  
    

  

-   Billions of semiconductors can be placed on an integrated circuit using a process called photolithography
    





Transistor Functionality





-   In various circuits Transistors can be made to:
    

  

-   Amplify or Attenuate electrical signals
    
-   Invert electrical signals
    
-   Store electrical voltage values
    
-   Switch electrical signals off and on
    

  

-   Transistors can be combined to create logic circuits commonly known as  “GATES”
    

  

-   Gates are packed into Integrated Circuits commonly known as “Chips”
    





Simple Silicon Semiconductor Devices






-   It could only add and subtract 4 bits at a time.
    



       AMD Athlon64 Processor


Use of Logic Gates in Computers





-   Primary Uses:
    
-   Switches and logic circuits that can be switched between 0 and 5 volts.  In this way a Switch can signify a “bit”   that is a 1 or a 0
    

  
Storage of voltage levels equivalent to 0 or 5 volts.  In this way a “bits” of memory can be implemented or  pixels on an LCD display on a laptop can be created

By combining gates we can create useful functions such as a the ability to store a bit of information






-   The purpose of a latch is to allow a data value to be stored temporarily. So that we can hold it and “use” it for awhile…like a “bit” of memory
    



![Clocked RS NAND latch](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ng5onQGc4UiIWobCXDRefs5UoRsrczQhv6frMOOLcLZAZ5h3WB6W3ug8vYIs_whtSL4xmdH-5SfCA2-tuMl7wOD3bncEHWQoF8-zYnK0uPlZmoPZO1ey5SSQxf9J1VhRNN7d5er_5q566RM=s2048)




Fetch, Decode, Execute Cycle





-   Computer instructions are stored (as bits) in memory.  To run a program, each instruction is:
    
-   Fetched from memory.
    
-   Decoded (the computer figures out what it should do based on the number).
    
-   Then the instruction is executed.
    
-   The speed at which this cycle occurs is determined
    

by the system clock




Cycle Times





-   Generally the faster your computer can get through a fetch-decode-execute cycle, the faster it will perform.
    
-   Cycle times are measured in “gigahertz”, a billion cycles per second.
    
-   PCs these days reach 3500 Megahertz or 3.5 Gigahertz (3 billion cycles/sec)
    





Memory





-   Each memory unit has its own address
    
-   Memory units are organized in groups of  Bytes (8 bits) or Words (16, 24, 32, 64 or 128 bits)
    






0  1  2  3  4 …………………………………..16 Billion





Random Access Memory






-   The main computer memory is called RAM (Random Access Memory)
    
-   It is “random” in that one may access any addressable memory unit independently of any other (and thus in “random” order).
    
-   In almost all modern machines the smallest single addressable amount of memory is one byte.
    
-   Memory is measured in megabytes or gigabytes or terabytes (millions, billions or trillions)
    






RAM chips on a Circuit board






Dynamic Random Access Memory






-   RAM allows for both reading and writing in memory.  Contrast this with ROM (read-only memory).
    
-   Most RAM is volatile, or “dynamic”.  When you turn off the power, the contents of RAM is lost.
    
-   Sometimes one talks about DRAM which is short for dynamic RAM).
    





Read Only Memory




-   Read Only Memory can only be read from
    
-   It’s contents cannot be altered or written over easily
    

  

-   This type of memory is used to hold instructions that need to always be there 
    

  
For example, the initial instructions that are executed when your PC is turned on which instructs the machine to load Windows from the disk drive



Machine Language





-   Every computer CPU has its machine language, the set of basic instructions it knows how to execute.  
    

  
A typical instruction might say, “get the contents of a memory location and put it in the accumulator register” (perhaps in preparation for adding it to another number).



Machine Instructions




-   Such an instruction would consist of two numbers:
    
-   One would be the address of the memory unit to be accessed.
    

The other would be the operation code of the instruction - the (somewhat arbitrary) number that refers to a unique and particular type of instruction




Structure of Instructions



Suppose we used 32 bits to encode a machine language instruction.




Information Transfer inside the CPU




-   Individual bits in a memory unit are transferred to the CPU in parallel (all at the same time).
    
-   This is opposed to serially (one at at time).
    
-   The same goes for information transferred between registers in the CPU.
    

A 64 bit machine can transfer 64 bits in parallel.



Central Processing Unit




-   manages the instruction-execution cycle
    
-   FETCH – DECODE – EXECUTE
    
-   coordinates the activities of other devices

-   input and output
    

  

-   Program Control
    

-   starting a program

-   integer arithmetic
    
-   comparing two quantities
    
-   shifting, rotating bits in a quantity
    
-   testing, comparing, and converting bits
    






Challenges to Continuation of Moore’s Law




-   The thickness (in atoms) between the silicon layers in transistors is getting very thin as we attempt to cram more transistors into the same amount of space…so much so that new materials need to be developed
    

  

-   HEAT!!  As we put more and more transistors on a chip, the ability to cool it and keep it from burning up is increasingly a problem
    

  

-   Noise -  As more transistors are packed ever more tightly together, the noise level of the circuits increases which affects reliability

What is a Data Communications Network?



It is an infrastructure that contains connection nodes and transmission pathways which allow the reliable exchange of data between connected parties




## Underlying Trends in Networks Today

-   The industry has evolved from a multitude of proprietary standards to the wholesale adoption of widely accepted standards 
-   This has resulted in the ability of practically anyone to connect to the large public networks available without having to engage in special engineering
-   It has dramatically reduced the overall cost of deploying and operating networks

## Shannon’s Data Communciation Model -- Six Components


-   An information source generates a message
    
-   A transmitter encodes the message as a signal
    
-   The signal is transmitted over a communications channel -- a medium that bridges the distance between the transmitter and the receiver
    
-   A source of noise is usually present in the communication channel -- this is a random element that modifies the encoded signal in unpredictable ways
    
-   The receiver extracts a signal from the communications channel and converts it back into the form of a message
    
-   The destination receives the message
    


## Shannon’s Model Illustrated
-   The six components of a data communications system:
![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/LFE_7SZtTKLA3v2iVThgomtq2xpWL2CCs-tnNDuYtjm0gK9zri9fhUyTShGWxrwlrIvD4qA6gr6S6YGKUTg4BoQdAn34bZo9mDZOSSfpFEqO5lymxsNqAaz9lybgC3wrgWymwyAAl2r_FH4=s2048)

## Transmitting and Receiving using Modems

-   In data communications, data may be transmitted as either analog or digital (discrete) signals
    
-   Analog signals are composed of waves
    
-   repeating waveforms are modulated (altered) to encode information
    
-   Digital data must be translated into modulated analog signals for transmission and the signal must be translated back into digital data at the receiver
    

Special devices called modems (modulate/demodulate) are used to perform these translations

## Modem Functionality
![fmmod](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/o_2jUg_9aMAL63ZvL8JHGIin7Zl7_c4VRnuzRD_U_FCH-wNQibidxXs3yjxC_kUoW_hmLoH4xALIubN_reEtwdnmnFoL_m7EPj6fsj3mxwcEsFH5IjQhgiClP6jsET4zwLo3vMRAe8sEr3k=s2048)

The diagram shows how the carrier varies in frequency corresponding to the data being transmitted

## Noise

-   In the transmission of information errors are thought of as noise.
    
-   The term comes from the early days of radio, where the transmission errors literally resulted in a noisy radio broadcast.
    
-   Noise is viewed as a (typically) random process.
    

## Error Detection
Today’s communications systems usually incorporate error detection  

This is achieved by adding additional data to a message that is calculated by the sum of all the bits in the message

When a message is received the sum is recalculated and compared to the received message.  If it matches, no errors were present.

## Encoding Information
We encode analog information into digital for  four reasons:

-   We need to represent it somehow in binary
    
-   We may need to compress the message size.
    
-   We may need to protect privacy and security.
    
-   We may need to detect (and possibly correct) error caused by noise
    

## Channel Properties

-   Bandwidth - how much information can travel through it in a given amount of time.  We often measure this in megahertz, but more intuitively we use bits/second.
    
-   Latency, how long does it take to get from one end to another.
    
-   Signal to noise ratio (SNR).  The ratio of signal to noise expressed in decibels
    

## Properties of Networks

-   Distance (geographical size)
    
-   Media (what carries the messages)
    
-   Signal (how is the information passed through the media).
    
-   Switching (handling many users )
    
## Topology (the physical configuration of the network)

-   A local area network (or LAN) is typically confined to a single organization spread over a distance that can be easily walked.
    
-   A wide area network (or WAN) is typically serving multiple entities, and is spread much farther.
    
## An internet is a network that includes multiple LANs and WANs
We distinguish between bounded media (Often called Terrestrial) and wireless media..

Typical bounded media include

-   Twisted pair wire (about 10 megabits/sec)
    
-   Coaxial cable (about 50 megabits/sec)
    
-   FiberOptics (about 10 gigabit/sec)
    

Wireless media include:

Radio

Infared

Laser

## Switching
One needs to switch between the messages of various users.  Two basic method types:

-   Circuit switching - a connection is established between users until the message is complete. Your voice telephone works on this principle
    
- Packet switching - messages are broken up into packets and multiple messages and packets are being carried at the same time over different paths

## Packet Switching Example
![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/9GCAvzlxEtGpuLZpT-7F5KA9a5EtNLYwW6oQWMrvDyclsbouzshPhSHczxrVcqDRHOY9jzCH_1q235Pt8GljwrpTALB_l9LyViM7XSo5Qda2AE-91-teLXlWNnzyOVoBy9vbedLzCMsuBxY=s2048)

Local and Wide Area Networks

## Uses of LANs
Wide-area networks are primarily used for communication.  Local-area networks are also used for communication as well as resource sharing, including:

-   Printers
    
-   Computing and Web servers
    
-   File servers
    

## LAN Topology
The topology of a LAN is the way the computers are connected together.  There are several common configurations:

-   Star
    
-   Bus
    
-   Ring
    
## Network Topologies
![nettopoc](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/zY2LXfR6F7tQ5M4Ux_EOm_j6mEAcf6wQ8i7OF3Juwh8jNC7sI9P3Kcc4he04ZIPE7xpo6qAAM_g58y8qNAO9XOM8QCuFEGKXQ89polVevuxhbN4DGp4H6js8ipldsrU_aTlohZqFnKFyrcE=s2048)

## Ethernet Switching

-   Ethernets use bus or ring topologies. 
    
-   To send a message, wait for an idle moment and send it.
    
-   All machines constantly listen to the network for messages addressed to them.
    
-   If someone else picks the same moment to send we have packet collision.
    

## Ethernet Packet Collision

-   Should packet collision occurs, both parties must re-send
    
-   But they must choose the moment randomly, or else they will re-collide
    
-   Packet collision limits the number of messages that can be send on ethernet LANs and determines the variable latency experienced by the users
    
## Ethernet Bus

## Complicated LANs

-   LANs tend to grow.  The Brown computer science LAN now has about 250 machines attached to it.
    
-   To handle this sort of traffic (and reduce the number of collisions) the LAN has been broken up into several sub-LANs.
    
Sub-LANs can be connected by switches and routers.

## Switches and Routers

-   Both bridges and routers allow messages to pass between one sub-LAN and another.
    
-   A bridge simply notes if the recipient of the message is in the other LAN, and if so, allows the message to cross over.
    
-   A router is used when there is more than one way to route the messag and must be used to access the   internet WAN
    
## Interconnected Lans

## Symmetry

-   Symmetric Networks are those where the data in both directions is more or less the same.  
    
-   Asymmetric networks are characterized by a large difference between data in one direction vs. the other……Web Traffic, File Transfers(FTPs), etc.

## Intranets

-   An Intranet is a closed network that has group of defined users 
    
-   (Intra-organizational)
    
-   Intranets exist for businesses, universities, trade organizations, etc.
    
-   Most Intranets are also connected to the Internet
    
## Network Nodes

-   Nodes are a location on a network where there is an aggregation of connections
    
-   Internet nodes are also those places where many smaller networks are actually connected to the Internet

## Wireless Media

-   Infrared is good between fixed locations.  It is also not bothered by noise.
    
-   Lasers are also excellent point to point systems with limited range
    
Radio frequency  networks are more flexible and allow the participants to be mobile and move while they communicate
       
## Wireless Networks

-   Radio data networks are the fastest growing type of network technology today.
    
-   This model is much like the terrestrial LANs we know and love except that it is total portable and works without cables and wall jacks!
    
## Types of Data Wireless

-   WiFi (802.11b/g)  High speed wireless with range up to 200 feet or so.  Speeds up to 100mbps
    
-   BlueTooth – Personal Area Network with range of up to 30 feet
    
-   GPRS/3G/4G/5G – Wide area data network used in conjunction with cellular telephone services
    
-   VSAT – Small antenna satellite technology used for high speed data communication over very large distances
    
## Mobile Wireless Networks aka…Cell Phones  
  
-   Originally invented by Motorola in cooperation with AT&T in early 1970’s
    
-   Huge increase in usage as a result of the rapid adoption of cellphones worldwide (> 2.5 Billion subscribers and growing at double digit rates)
    
-   Two dominant cellphone technologies
    

-   GSM (Global system for mobile communications) (80%)
    
-   CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) (20%)
    
-   Both technologies incorporate data along with voice and messaging
    
-   The cellphone system would not be possible without very sophisticated computing systems to enable it
    
## The Original Cellphone

10 Hours to charge
    
-   Weighed almost 4 pounds
    
## Cell phone history trivia
    
-   In 1978 AT&T commissioned Mackenzie research to project the market for cell phones in the U.S.
    
-   Mackenzie estimated that the total market by the year 2000 would be 1 million units
    
-   Today there are over 200 million cellphone subscribers in the U.S. alone and still growing
    
-   Mackenzie’s research did not anticipate the precipitous drop in handset cost which would make cell phones popular with consumers as opposed to businesses alone

-   Programming languages are divided up into low-level languages and high-level languages.
    

  

-   The closer the language is to machine language, the lower the level.
    

  

-   High level languages make it much easier to develop large complex programs.
    





Machine Language

  

-   Every computer CPU has its machine language, the set of instructions it knows how to execute. This is the lowest level. 
    

  

-   A typical instruction might say, get the contents of a memory location and put it in the accumulator (perhaps in preparation for adding it to another number).
    




A Machine Language Program

  

-   Put contents of memory location 10 in accumulator.
    

  

-   Add contents of memory location 11 to accumulator.
    

  

-   Put contents of accumulator back in location 10
    

  

-   It might look like
    

110011011111100111110000011110000010000011111

100010001000100100001000001111000001110000000

010000100010010000101010000111001110000011000                               

  
  

…..not very user friendly!  But believe it or not, computers were programmed by humans in machine language at one time.




Natural Languages

  

-   Computers don’t understand English
    
-   Need to deal with
    

-   Ambiguity
    
-   Redundancy
    
-   Literalness
    

  
  

-   So, we express what a computer should do in a formal language
    


 


Assembly Language

  

-   Assembly language is machine language made slightly easier.
    

  

-   LDACC 0A    ; (current_balance)
    
-   ADD 0B         ; (add new_check)
    
-   STACC 0A     ; (store new_balance)
    




High-Level Languages

  

In a high-level language the previous piece of code might look like this:

  

Input current_balance

current_balance = current_balance +new_check;

store current_balance

  


Compilers and Interpreters

  

-   A compiler is a program than turns a high-level language program into a machine-language program. (Then when one wants, once can execute the machine-language version.)
    

  

-   An interpreter is a program that executes the high-level program directly and translates it into machine language on the fly.




Some High Level Languages in Use Today

  

-   Fortran
    
-   Basic
    
-   PL/1
    
-   Cobol
    
-   C
    
-   C++
    
-   VISUAL BASIC
    

  

-   Pascal
    
-   LISP
    
-   ADA
    
-   JAVA
    
-   PHP
    
-   Python
    
-   Javascript
    





Interpreters vs. Compilers

  

-   Interpreters are easier to write than compilers.
    

  

-   Interpreter languages allow immediate editing and execution without the intermediate step of compiling.
    

  

-   Compiled code runs faster than interpreted code however so it is preferred in performance sensitive applications.
    

  

But this is slowly changing…..Why?






Simplifying The Translation

  

Matrix::Compute(double* values, int size) {  
  for(int i=0; i<size; i++) {  
      for(int j=0; j<size; j++) {  
        if(i<j && values[i*size+j]<0.0)  
            values[i*size+j] = values[j*size+i];  
        values[i*size+j] = 2*values[i*size+j];  
      }  
  }  
}

Flowcharting a design





Pseudo Code(ing)

  

-   Allows you to write a program in english for the purpose of design without having to worry about specific computer language syntax and allows the programmer to concentrate on the logical sequences
    

  

-   Start
    

-   Input (amount)
    
-   Amount = amount*4.33
    
-   If amount < 58 then print “It’s less than 58”
    
-   Else print “It’s over 58”
    
-   End
    






Python!

  

-   Python is a great language for learning basic elements of programming
    

  

-   Easy to understand syntax
    

  

-   Runs in an Interpreter for instant results!
    

  

-   Available for free at  [www.python.org](http://www.python.org/)
    

  

-   Runs on practically any computer!
    
-   We will use Python later in the course
    




Real world problem

  

A  real-world example is assigning gates at airports.  Some constraints are:

-   A plane that lands at time t1 should be assigned a gate for use at time t2 > t1.
    
-   If a plane is at a gate, no other plane may be assigned that gate, etc.
    
-   Find an assignment of gates that minimizes passenger time (and perhaps distance).
    




The Price of Failure

  

-   The opening of the new Denver Airport was delayed for almost one year in 1994!
    

  

-   The software which handled the routing of luggage from the gates to the various luggage carousels was so complex that it could not be fixed in time for the opening and the airport was two large to operate without it
    

  

-   The delay in opening cost over $1Million per day!
    



Quoted from the morning news

  

The morning news reported that the opening of Denver's new international airport would be delayed indefinitely until problems with the automated baggage handling system are fixed.

  

 While the video showed the machinery shredding open suitcases and throwing clothing all over the floor, the voice over of the airport director stated, "We think it's mostly a software problem."



Even 120 Computers couldn’t figure this out!  
A small portion of the Denver Conveyer System

Complexity

  

-   Software is becoming more complex as we attempt to solve more complex  and difficult problems
    

  

-   Managing complexity is a huge problem in software reliability and cost
    

  

-   The problem is getting worse, not better as reflected in industry software issues worldwide
    


 


Cases in Complexity

  

Fred Brooks : Former IBM 360 Development Mgr

Wrote the famous “The Mythical Man Month” about the trials and tribulations of writing the Operating System for the IBM 360 in the 1960’s, at that time the most ambitious software project ever undertaken

  

Brook’s Law - Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later." 

  

Made the decision to put 8 bits in a byte instead of 6 which allowed upper and lower case characters to be accomodated

  

When on to found the CS Dept. at the Univ. of North Carolina

Operating System

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ntVlLb40MWzsrO-B9TRFYUUGILwcQZ391koK2JGu1NR7MlOT07L5fRvXW0ILTNI-g5b8prt3Ff_eCzkFQJNgwIWza8gi1tv5i_xo3wO7ZiYRS1LOZFIipvzzFuscDIw-yCTh6MhfZkVT_Jg=s2048)  

The  OS is a collection of resident programs that

-   manage the system’s resources
    
-   supervise the execution of processes
    
-   provide useful services
    





OS Components

  

An operating system is a collection of programs that perform the following tasks:

  

-   Managing user requests (Supervisor)
    
-   Interpreting user commands (User Interfaces)
    
-   I/O control
    
-   Memory management
    
-   File management
    
-   Execution-Monitoring
    
-   Security
    
-   Multitasking
    




System Calls

  

-   The work of the OS comes about through system calls to one of the OS components.
    

  

-   The system calls are initiated either by the user (e.g., by a mouse click) or by the user  application software.
    

  

-   For instance, saving a file to a directory location.
    





User Interface

  

-   Most computer users used to  interact with the OS by clicking on icons with the mouse.
    
-   Some operating systems (e.g., Unix or Dos) typically use text-based interfaces. E.g.,
    




The User Interface

  

-   Text-based Command Line Interpreters (CLIs)
    

-   terse, powerful
    
-   steeper learning curves, unforgiving
    

  

-   Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)
    

-   intuitive, user-friendly
    
-   slower, less efficient
    






The User Interface sets the Tone

  

-   PCs universally used text based command line interfaces until 1983
    
-   Then, Apple, using research from Xerox Parc, introduced the Lisa, followed quickly by the Macintosh which changed everything
    
-   WYSIWYG comes alive !!
    
-   Arcane commands are OUT!                 …GUIs are IN !!
    
-   Microsoft introduces Windows in ‘84
    




A Typical Command Line Interface

File Management

  

-   Files are collections of data arranged in a specified format for use by programs
    

  

-   Files can reside in memory as well as in peripheral devices such as disk drives, CD-ROMs or tape drives
    

  

-   Every file has a name and attributes that specify its size, its location and its type
    





File Manager

  

-   Creating and maintaining references to a system’s files is the responsibility of the file manager.
    

  
  

-   The actual address of a file is a pathname, which is made up of the folders in which the file is located (sometimes called directories) and the file name.
    





The File Manager maintains the hierarchy between the physical and logical  
  

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/CJn3Bffr_XuF6negrQ8afdoFZxwLr7LbHKfWUscOwXzy4lTTSz0G0Adme1oRdS9ds0x5D939Nlc9KC26X9Hu79lpOzhAwe0xiZtXaPtdhsxZQOXJdEkwq0gAPTBs1wJA5I2eTJoI5q_9VoA=s2048)




The File Manager Keeps Track of File Types

  

-   It is important to know what type of data is stored in any given set of locations
    

  

-   Types include PROGRAM INSTRUCTIONS, TEXT, IMAGES, VIDEO, SOUND as well as numerical data such as INTEGERS and Real NUMBERS
    

  

-   The file manager keeps track of the different types of data and its location

-   The file manager keeps track of the different types of data and its location
    





Input/Output (I/O) Drivers

  

-   An I/O driver is a special program that knows how to communicate with a peripheral device and the CPU
    

  

-   To read or write a file to a disk the file manager determines the name and location of the file, and control is passed to the disk’s I/O driver, which will send commands to the disk arm, read head, etc.
    




The Memory Manager

  

-   When we click on a Word document, the OS must bring first the Word program into RAM, and then the particular document we wish to work on.
    

  

-   Allocating segments of RAM to each program is the responsibility of the memory manager.
    




Execution Monitor

  

-   If an error occurs in the course of running a program, control is passed to the execution monitor.
    

  

-   The execution monitor is responsible for ensuring that an error caused by a program does not cause the entire system to crash.
    




Multitasking

  

-   While most modern computers can only execute one operation at a time, it is often useful to give users the illusion that several things are going on at the same time
    

  

-   This ability is called multitasking
    

  

-   This is most apparent if several users are sharing the same computer, but it is also useful for single user computers that are running multiple programs
    




Components of Multitasking

  

-   Context switching--going from one process to another (like printing one file while working on another), since I/O is so much slower than internal computation  –the OS interrupts the current process; stores information for resuming that process; loads and commences the next ready (waiting) process
    

  

-   CPU Scheduling--deciding which process to work on next.
    

  

-   Virtual memory-- needed when there are multiple programs running, it allows the machine to behave as if all the programs were in RAM at the same time.  It accomplishes this by using the disk to act like temporary RAM…this is called a RAMDISK
    






CPU Task Scheduling

  

-   CPU SCHEDULER–determines the order for ready and waiting processes

ROBIN method




Security

  

-   The OS provides some basic security features
    

  

-   Password access
    

  

-   Firewall to block unwanted access from the Internet
    

  

-   Monitors your virus control programs
    

  

-   Monitors the integrity of your files
    

  

-   Generally insufficient, which requires additional security software to be added to the system

Just about everything outside of the CPU/Main Memory falls under the general classification of an “I/O or Peripheral Device”





I/O Subsystem

  

-   Input/Output
    

-   exchanging data and instructions between 
    

   the user and the computer

  

-   The user may be a human being, but it may  also be a machine….like a car engine or a valve in a nuclear power plant
    

  

Storage (Non Volatile)

-   auxiliary storage for data and instructions
    





Storage Systems

  

-   Backup or alternative storage in place of (volatile) RAM
    

  

-   cheaper, mass storage for long term use
    

  

-   storage devices (and media) are distinguished by their capacities, speed, and cost
    





Memory Storage Systems

Types of Access

  

-   RANDOM ACCESS (Main Memory, Flash)
    

-   items are independently addressed
    
-   access time is constant
    

-   DIRECT ACCESS (Disc Drives)
    

-   items are independently addressed in regions
    
-   access time is variable—though not significantly
    

-   SEQUENTIAL ACCESS (Tape Systems)
    

-   items are organized in sequence (linearly)
    
-   access time is significantly variable
    







Magnetic Tape-Sequential Access

  

-   stores data represented by magnetized particles in linear tracks
    
-   magnetized clusters or domains are aligned to represent binary codes

Disk vs. File Organization

  

-   data is stored in blocks
    
-   blocks occupy sectors
    
-   sectors on tracks
    
-   files have names
    
-   files are indefinite in size
    
-   files may be updated (in part or whole)

Serial Computer Cable




Where are parallel busses used?

  

-   All of the paths inside the CPU and between the CPU, main memory and video processor are implemented using parallel busses for the very fastest transfer rates.
    

-   Any plug in cards use parallel busses as well as internal magnetic and optical disk drives.
    

  

-   Most of these busses are either 16, 32 or 64 bits wide
    






Where are serial busses used?

  

-   Serial busses are primarily used to connect external devices and peripherals.  The data transfer rates of peripherals connected via serial are generally slower than those connected by parallel.
    

  

-   Serial is convenient, relatively inexpensive and getting faster all of the time.
    

  

-   The current serial standard for peripherals is called USB 2.0 and USB 3.0
    




USB 2.0

  

-   Max transfer speed of 400Mbps (Megabits per second), 40 times faster than the predecessor USB 1.1
    

  

-   Supports up to 127 devices connected to the same controller chip!
    

  

-   A USB cable can be 5 meters long without causing any performance problems
    

  

-   USB has become the ubiquitous serial connection standard for practically every external PC peripheral
    




USB 3.0!

  

-   Standard introduced in 2008
    

  

-   Up to 5 Gigabits per second!
    

  

-   10 times faster than USB 2.0
    




USB 4.0

  
  

-   Introduced at the end of 2020
    

  

        Up to 40GBps!






Apple’s Thunderbolt

  

-   “The most advanced I/O EVER!”  per Apple
    
-   Supports high resolution video and high performance data transfers through a SINGLE compact port
    

  

-   Up to 20 Gb/sec transfer speed!
    
-   40 times faster that USB 2 and 4 time faster than USB 3.   Compatible with USB 4.0

Clocking Data on the Bus

  

-   Both serial and parallel busses transfer data using a clock signal that ensures that data is sent and received at certain times based on the clock speed.  
    

  

-   Without the clock, data transfers would be less reliable given the variation in cable length and other environmental factors

# Binary Notation and Intro to Computer Graphics

## Dealing with Binary

-   Binary numbers in their native notation are not very user friendly
-   Hex notation (short hand for Hexadecimal) is an easier and more intuitive way to express binary values
-   Many programs and programming languages allow the use of Hex to denote binary values

Hex Notation using 4 bit Nibbles
Binary    Hex    

0000       0       

0001     1     

0010       2       

0011       3

   1101 D    

   1110 E    

   1111 F

Hex Example….

-   So the one byte Binary numbers:
    

-        0010 0001 = 21 Hex =Decimal 33
    

            2     1

        Or 128 + 64 +32+16 +8+4+2+1

  

-         1010 0100 = A4  Hex =Decimal 164
    

        Or  128+64+32+16+8+4+2+1
emember……

-   DIGITAL - Digital means discrete.  
    
-   Digital representation is comprised of a limited number of data points to encode information. 
    
-   Our electronic devices use Digital techniques to work with data and information
    
-   Since we have a limited number of data points to work with, it means that all digital representations are approximations of the real thing
    
Representing Digital Samples
-   The values associated with Digital Samples are  stored in Binary form, which is a very easy and inexpensive way for electrical machines to store and manipulate values by using simple building block electronic circuits built out of transistors
    
-   So, you should think of a computer or any digital device as a machine that can store, manipulate and move large amounts of binary information at very high rates of speed
    

## Graphics Buzzwords

-    Pixel- 
    
-   a spatial sample of a digital image. A pixel element is the basic component of a digitized image, which contains a set of numbers representing the features (color, intensity) of that spatial sample (a pixel may only have ONE color and intensity, therefore it is the lowest element of an image)
    
-   Bitmap-
    
-   a method of representing and storing digital images and graphics whereby the image is composed of a collection of individual pixels
    

## More Buzz

-   Resolution- 
    
-   The capacity for detail contained in a message or signal. Representations with high resolution capture more detail than those with low resolution 
    
-   In the case of digital images, resolution is primarily determined by :
    
-   Number of pixels
    
-   Size of Pixels
    
-   Density of Pixels
    

## Digital Images and Pictures  


A picture (as on your computer monitor) consists of many “pixels” 

(= “picture element”).  A pixel is a very small area of uniform color and intensity.  Think of your laptop monitor as consisting of over 1,000,000 discrete small squares, or pixels.

## Bitmap Graphics

  

-      To display things on the computer monitor, a modern-day computer has built in hardware (memory) for storing a “bitmap” that represents the “picture” that should be displayed on the monitor.  
    
-   The Bitmap is stored in MEMORY…..the more bits stored, the more memory required….
    

Graphic images
-   (for display) graphic images are composed of pixels
    
-   this type of graphic is called bit-mapped or raster graphics
    
-   the image is stored as a sequence of bits (a) representing the pixel properties (b)
    
Resolution
This is a very low resolution (3 pixels by 4 pixels) picture of the letter “Y”.

Red, Green, Blue   RGB

  

-   RGB color values are supported in all browsers.
    
-   An RGB color value is specified with: rgb( RED , GREEN , BLUE ).
    
-   Each parameter defines the intensity of the color as an integer between 0 and 255.
    
-   For example, rgb(0,0,255) is rendered as blue, because the blue parameter is set to its highest value (255) and the others are set to 0
    
Color Levels of Intensity

  

-   For a black and white (Grayscale) picture we might use, say, 8 bits (one byte) to represent 256 levels of intensity, from 0 (black) to 255 (white)
    

  

-   For a color picture for each pixel we would have 3 bytes, one each for the intensity of red, green, and blue respectively
    

  

-   (0,0,0) would still be black, while (255,0,0) would be red, (255,255,255) is white, etc.  
    

  

-   This is commonly called RGB (Red, Green, Blue)
    

  

-   RGB typically uses 3 bytes (24 bits)  for each pixel so that equates to 16,777,216 different possible colors
    
Image Resolution

  

-   Resolution (Accuracy) is determined by two primary factors, pixel size and number of pixels
    

  

-   Higher Resolution renders an image with greater accuracy for any given size
    

  

-   Resolution is directly proportional to number of bits used for storage (memory)
    

  

-   Color accuracy is also proportional to memory as is brightness and  contrast since their values must also be stored for each pixel
    

  

-   There is a delicate balance between image size and apparent resolution
    
Advantages of Bitmap Graphics

  

-   It is easier to create hardware to go from a bitmap representation to the actual display on the monitor (which is why monitors use bitmaps)
    

  

-   It is easier to draw pictures of things with imprecise boundaries, (or that consist of so many parts it would not be feasible to draw them all)
    

  

-   Your PC utilizes Bitmap Graphics to display everything that appears on your screen
    

  

-   Ability to create multiple layers which can be overlayed to create composites

## Vector Graphics

-   An alternative scheme for representing images is called “vector graphics”  In  vector graphics objects are represented explicitly.
    

## Vector Graphic Images

-   Object-oriented or vector graphics treat the image as a collection of graphic objects such as lines, curves, and figures
    
-   Best rendered on special vector graphics machines
    
-   Vector graphics are resolution independent and highly scalable
    
-   Vector graphics are more easily edited and often more compact in storage
    
-   Vector graphic images must often be converted to bitmapped images for display on bitmapped systems such as a PC
    

## Vector Graphics

  -   the image is composed of graphic objects (lines, curves, figures, etc.)
    
-   each object is defined by its graphic properties
    
-   these properties may be changed and scaled easily
    

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/JcxMYgmt3mWfX5C23Z95T7wuG6no3U--_HhFmw7FpKknohC8MAANbNlkZPRCR2WzwZ8xV3sencoPrug-hJmmprP6TTAC2M906MwzXFvzDIRdv00r0dAQW5F7Mmhwk9nUS3_ZMimkXiBSWrk=s2048)

## Vector Graphics

-   each object occupies a separate layer
    
-   layers may be moved, scaled, and arranged in different orders
    
-   objects may be deleted and inserted easily

# Lecture 8 Legal Issues in Computing


## Some of the Dominant Legal Issues in Computing

  -   Ownership
    
-   Intellectual Property Protection (IP)
    
-   Anti-Trust and Unfair Competition
    
-   File Sharing
    
-   Fraud
    
-   Negligence
    
-   Privacy (Covered later in Databases)
    

  
### Ownership

-   When you write a piece of software or design a unique webpage, who owns it?
    
-   Answer:  You Do!!
    
-   Who gets to decide who can use it and for what purpose?
    
-   Answer:  You Do!!
    

#### What are some of your options?

-   You can give unrestricted free usage of it, otherwise known as Freeware or Shareware
    
-   You can license it, for a fee, with restrictions on its use
    
-   You can sell it, lock stock and barrel and transfer ownership altogether
    

Most common ownership model is licensing model

-   Typical restrictions may include:
    
-   Copy restrictions
    
-   Limited to certain number of  computers
    
-   Limited to certain number of users
    
-   Limited in Time and must be renewed
    
-   Limited Geography of use
    
-   Limited Functionality
    

How do you protect your IP?

-   Copyright registration
    
-   Trademark registration
    
-   Patents ( for unique invention)
    
-   Copy protection
    
-   On-line registration for every new installation
    
-   Protect the source code!
    
-   Audits
    


### Copyrights

-   Protects the arrangement of your design including the text, the graphics, the industrial design
    
-   Sometimes hard to prove infringement in a lawsuit and often left up to “interpretation” and common sense
    

### TradeMark

-   A form of copyright which protects your public brand image and associated design of things like Logos and advertising material 
    

  

-   McDonald’s Golden Arches is a classic example of this….
    

### Patents

 -   Reserved for protecting unique innovations and inventions that represent a “new” approach to solving a problem or creating a product or process
    
-   Takes a formal process of searches, filings and disclosures
    
-   Approximately 18 month process minimum and $5-10K in cost
    
-   Patents expire after 17 years in most cases
    

### The Famous Apple vs. Microsoft lawsuit over Windows

  -   Apple introduces the first commercial computer using a GUI,  in 1983, based on pioneering work done by Xerox
    
-   Microsoft was set to introduce Windows 1.0 in 1985 and entered into an agreement with Apple to license and sub-license certain aspects of the GUI interface
    
-   In return, Apple was granted use of certain Microsoft products for its computers

### Apple vs. Microsoft

-   In 1988 Apple files a $5.5Billion lawsuit claiming patent infringement and breach of contract
    
-   At issue was Apple’s contention that Microsoft exceeded the terms of the license and used parts of the design that were not included in the license
    
-   And, Xerox then sues Apple claiming that its IP was infringed by Apple!
    

### Apple vs. Microsoft

-   On September 19, 1994, the U.S. Court of Appeals upheld by a 3-0 vote a Federal District Court’s 1992 ruling that Microsoft’s Windows and displays (or graphical user interfaces) did not violate Apple’s copyrights in its Macintosh screen display
    
-   the District Court ruled that over 90 percent of Windows was within the scope of the original 1985 license agreement
    
-   It concluded that the remaining elements, such as various icons, were primarily graphical symbols representing generic ideas or purely functional components of the program, or were insufficiently original to merit copyright protection
    
-   A major flaw in Apple’s case was that Xerox was the inspiration for both Apple and Microsoft’s efforts
    

### The GUIs are the problem!

-   Copyright law essentially protects the original expression of ideas in tangible form, such as books, artwork, music and computer software, from unauthorized copying, distribution or modification. It does not apply to ideas. 
    
-   While it is well-settled that copyright protections extend to computer software, the extent to which copyright law protects screen displays has been the subject of much litigation, with many courts reaching varied results
    

### Anti-Trust

Sherman Anti-Trust Act of 1890

-   Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal.
    
-   Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a felony
    

### Standard Oil

-   The Sherman Act was legislated in response to John D. Rockefeller’s attempts to monopolize the emerging oil industry through his company, Standard Oil
    
-   His son, John D. Rockefeller Jr., was a Brown alumnus and major benefactor to the University
    

### U.S. versus IBM

  -   By the 1960’s IBM dominated the computer industry with a >60% market share
    
-   In January 1969, the government began a sweeping antitrust investigation into IBM's dominance and attempted to break it into smaller companies that would compete against one another
    

### U.S versus IBM

-   During the six most critical years of the trial, from 1975 to 1980, the parties called 974 witnesses and read 104,400 pages of transcripts
    
-   The 13-year investigation, which required IBM to retain 200 attorneys at one point, fizzled in the early '80s as the computing landscape shifted from mainframes to personal computers. The government abandoned the tainted effort entirely in 1982, as clones of the IBM PC eroded Big Blue's dominance
    

### U.S. versus IBM

  -   With IBM, the Justice Department was trying to hit a moving target, but the target had moved so much there was no point in shooting anymore--so they dropped the case
    
-   People who worked for IBM in the '80s and early '90s said the company routinely fell victim to "pricing death strategy"--a reluctance to lower prices below cost, even on products that weren't selling--to avoid what the government would call predatory pricing
    
-   Viewed today, the Government’s case against IBM appears ludicrous to many in retrospect
    

### U.S versus Microsoft

-   In 1998 the  Federal govt. filed a massive lawsuit against Microsoft which charged that it was in violation of anti-trust laws by having engaged in
    

-   Predatory conduct
    
-   Bundling
    
-   Exclusionary Contracts
    

As relates to the deployment of Microsoft Internet

Explorer at the expense of Netscape, a competing product

### U.S. vs. Microsoft

-   Predatory Conduct
    
-   The lawsuit claims that Microsoft, by giving away Internet Explorer for free, is exercising unfair advantage against Netscape, which sells its browser. By doing so, Microsoft is drying the revenue of Netscape, driving the company out of business
    

### U.S. vs. Microsoft

-   Bundling
    
-   Microsoft not only gave Internet explorer for free; it also started closely linking Windows to Internet explorer. The lawsuit claims that, by closely bundling Internet Explorer with Windows operating system, Microsoft has significant advantage over its rivals
    

### U.S. vs. Microsoft

-   Exclusionary Contracts
    
-   The lawsuit claims that, by forcing Internet service providers (ISPs) to distribute Internet Explorers with their products, instead of other browser, and in turn providing a link in Windows to these ISPs, Microsoft has used its monopoly to take unfair advantage against the competition. 
    
-   By providing discounts and incentives to manufacturers and Internet service providers Microsoft takes advantage and uses that advantage to gain monopoly in the browser market
    

### Blood in the Water!

-   Sensing blood in the water, many additional lawsuits were filed by Microsoft’s competitors, by State attorney generals and several foreign governments, including the EEU.
    
-   At this time (2003), Microsoft has avoided a breakup of the Company but has had to make considerable concessions as part of settling some of the suits.
    
-   If Microsoft was a French company, there would be a statue of Bill Gates on the Champs Elysee!
    

### Politics and Anti-Trust

-   The use of Anti-Trust suits by the Government is very related to the politics of the administration in power at the time. 
    
-   The Microsoft suit was brought during the Clinton administration
    
-   Microsoft has dodged a lot of very serious bullets and remedies  since the Bush administration has been in office
    

### Anti-Trust against Apple

  

-   Various lawsuits around the world have been filed against Apple for restriction of content associated with its iPod, iPhone and iPad products when using the iTunes and iPhone App Store.
    
-   Additionally there were cases pending against Apple and AT&T for restrictions on the purchase and operation of the iPhone
    



### File Sharing

-   The legal debate centers on the issue of whether you have the right to share copyrighted material with other parties as opposed to making copies for your own personal use.
    

  
## File Sharing Lawsuits

  -   The Recording Industry Association of America has filed many lawsuits against people trading unauthorized music online, including lawsuits against 69 people who allegedly used university networks to download music
    
-   Recent cases levied a fine of over $100K against a woman that shared files over Kazaa.    
Brown U. Response

  -   Brown University issued a statement reacting to the lawsuits: "Brown University has not yet received notice of the lawsuits announced today by the RIAA. If the University is served with a subpoena that meets the requirements of the law, Brown will comply as fully as possible. Until the University is served, however, it does not know the extent of the RIAA action. Any Brown student found in violation of the law will also be subject to University disciplinary action."   

### Debate rages on over swapping of music and videos 

-   Despite the growth of legitimate, paid music-downloading services online, the legal, moral and economic debate over free music and video swapping shows no sign of being resolved soon.   


## IP Litigation involving Apple Inc.

-   A Very, Very long list in which Apple is both plaintiff  and defendants at various times
    
-   It is fair to say that Apple has spent 100s of millions of dollars on litigation around its products, intellectual property and trade practices
    
-   [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc._litigation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc._litigation)
    

### Apple and Trademarks

-   Between just 2008 and 2010 Apple filed over 350 complaints over the improper use of its trademarks,
    

### iPod, iPad, iTouch, iPhone, Apple and Safari

### Apple vs. Samsung

In 2011 Apple alleged that Samsung  used some of its IP in its Galaxy III cell phone

-   Apple was simultaneously suing Motorola for similar patent infringement
    
-   Known as the Mobile Patent Wars aimed at the incredible success of Android in the market, owned by Google
    
### Apple vs. Samsung

-   Apple’s actions against Samsung eventually spread to 50 different lawsuits across more than a dozen countries
    
-   Samsung and Google countersued Apple in almost all cases
    
-   In August 2012 a U.S. Court held for Apple and assessed $1B in damages against Samsung   


### Apple vs. Samsung

-   Apple requested that Samsung be forced to stop selling its Galaxy Android based phones in the U.S. while the appeals are pending.
    
-   Largest single damages award in recent history.
    

### So who is winning?

-   Apple has been largely successful against Samsung, with the bulk of rulings and court decisions going in Apple’s favor. Apple has also struck a blow against companies (like Motorola) using predatory licensing on standards-essential patents to seek bans on competing products, and can perhaps claim a moral victory with Samsung outright admitting some of its products copied Apple technology.  


### What have they actually won?

  

-   A settlement reached in 2018 appears to have prevailed after a slew of appeals
    

  

-   A jury awarded Apple $500M in damages
    

  

-   “And if I had to characterize it, it didn’t really accomplish anything,” said Brian J. Love, a Santa Clara University law professor who tracked the case. “Close to a decade of litigation, hundreds of millions of dollars spent on lawyers, and at the end of the day, NO products were removed from the market”
    


### The Cost of Litigation

  
  
  

-   Who pays for these hundreds of     lawsuits?
    

  

-   Ans:   We Do!  It’s built into the price of selling the product.

Volkswagen admits 11 million diesel cars      have sneaky software installed !!!!

Possibly the most expensive Computer enabled fraud ever…so far

  

-   VW falsified emissions data for turbo diesel cars when they were being measured on the test station
    
-   Software changed the engine parameters and performance when car was actually being driven on the road and the car emissions increased substantially in real driving as opposed to testing
    
-   This deception was intentional and approved by senior managers at VW.
    
-   The fraud was initially discovered by student scientists at West Virginia U.  who were comparing the performance of various turbo diesel cars as part of a research project.

Consequences of “Dieselgate”

  

-   Over 11 million cars worldwide and half a million in the U.S. are implicated in the deception
    
-   VW has pledged $30B to rectify the problem and compensate owners!
    
-   In addition they have agreed to a $2.8B fine imposed by the U.S. Govt.
    
-   Criminal indictments have been handed down in Germany against senior leadership that is implicated in the scandal
    
-   VW stock lost over 50% of its value but has recovered
    
-   Similar issues are under investigation against Audi, Volvo, Renault, Fiat and Hyundai diesels

## Negligence



Boeing 737 Max Airliner

  

-   In order to compete with the latest Airbus NEO airliner, Boeing decided to evolve the venerable 737, instead of designing a plane from scratch
    
-   In so doing, they selected new, more efficient turbofan engines which required that the engines be mounted in  different location on the wing.
    
-   When they tested the new design they discovered that under some circumstances the nose of the aircraft would elevate, thereby increasing the possibility of a stall condition
    



Changing the engine position changes the flight characteristics of the plane



The solution - MCAS

  

-    Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS)
    

  

-   MCAS was a new software module that compensated for the plane’s undesirable nose up condition
    
-   Boeing purposely failed to disclose the presence of MCAS, which ultimately led to two crashes, one in Indonesia and the other in Ethiopia with the loss of over 300 lives.
    
-   All 737 MAX aircraft were grounded for 18 months as a result and Boeing’s overall liability was estimated at $19B
    
-   The Federal Aviation Administration was also found to be complicit in Boeing’s behavior as they let Boeing self certify the 737 MAX

Global Cost
Norton Study Calculates Cost of Global Cybercrime: $114 Billion Annually

One of World’s Largest Cybercrime Studies Reveals More Than One Million Victims a Day 
According to the Norton Cybercrime Report  more than two thirds of online adults (69 percent) have been a victim of cybercrime in their lifetime. Every second 14 adults become a victim of cybercrime, resulting in more than one million cybercrime victims every day4. For the first time, the Norton Cybercrime Report reveals that 10 percent of adults online have experienced cybercrime on their mobile phone.   
  
The Current Situation…and increasingly so….

-   Decreasing privacy
    

-   Social Networks – Data Vacuum Cleaers
    
	 
Our personal information is the “blood” in the system

We live in an Age of Auto Surveillance

There is no statute of limitations on our digital lives

Globalized Cybercrime

Emergence of a Cyberspace Arms Race        


### Mobile under increasing attack

-   And the people most at risk are men ages 18 to 34 who use mobile devices to connect to the internet. In other words, PCs pose a broadly dangerous entry point for cybercriminals, but smartphones are worse. The information is especially troubling because people use smartphones with increasing frequency as the primary tools for their online work and play.  
      
    The number of new malicious programs targeting the Android platform has almost trebled in the second quarter of the year, according to figures from Kaspersky Lab’s Q2 report on IT threat evolution. Over the three months in question, over 14,900 new malicious programs targeting this platform were added to Kaspersky Lab’s database.
    

### Let’s just face it…

-   The security perimeter is gone
    
-   Too many inter-connected networks & devices
    
-   Too many doors & windows from one environment to another to secure the network in the old-fashioned way
    
-   Today, difficult to say with certainty where one network/system ends and another 
    
-   Due to complex series of interconnections, new/untested technology, people interactions, insecurity always remains
    
	=> 100% security doesn’t exist

### Security as a Discipline

-   There are several important aspects, or tenets of security
    
-   Identification/Authentication
    
-   Authorization 
    
-   Privacy
    
-   Information integrity
    
-   Non-repudiation
    
-   System Availability
    
-   Security Enablers
    
-   Encryption
    
-   Digital Signatures
    
-   Public Key Infrastructure
    
-   Redundancy and Fault Tolerance
    
-   Biometrics
    
-   Virus and Malware Detection
    
## What is Authentication ?

-   Answers the question  “Who am I?”
    
-   Can be implemented with weak or strong methods but usually involves something you know, something you have, and/or something you are
    
-   User ID
    
-   Passwords
    
-   Other “secret” info
    
-   Digital Tokens or Certificates
    
-   Biometrics
    
-   It is the most common area of attack on IT systems because it opens so many other doors
    
-   Consumers are very vulnerable to attacks in this area because they are not very good at keeping secrets
    
-   Vulnerable to “Social Engineering”
    
## Authentication

-   Process to positively identify a party participating in electronic interaction
    
-   Attempting to answer the question: 
    
-   who are you (identify)
    
-   are you who you say you are (confirm)
    
-   Methods based on:
    
-   Who you are (…fingerprint, retina, DNA) 
    
-   What you know (…password, PIN)
    
-   What you have (…cards, digital certificates)
    
-   Examples:
    
-   UserID/Passwords
    
-   Cards (mag-stripe and chip)
    
-   PINs
    
-   Biometrics
    
-   Digital Certificates

Token-Based Digital Identity   
  
### Currently used biometric technologies

-   Fingerprint verification
    
-   Hand geometry
    
-   Voice verification
    
-   Retinal scanning
    
-   Iris scanning
    
-   Signature verification
    
-   Facial verification
    
-   Keyboard Dynamics
    
## Digital Certificates

-   Digital Certificates are digital files that are issued to you and are unique to you as an individual
    
-   In order to receive one, you must prove who you are to the Certificate Authority that issues the certificate to you
    
-   Certificates are issued in different “flavors” or strengths depending upon what they authorize you to do
    
-   The certificate may be used to digitally “sign” an electronic document and has the same legal status as your written signature
    
## Weak vs. Strong Authentication

  -   An example of “weak” authentication is:
    
-   Username and 4 character pin
    
-   Stronger authentication would be:
    
-   Username and 8 character alphanumeric password with                                           no repeating characters
      

**Even Stronger authentication would be:

**Username 
+
16 character alphanumeric pw with no repeating characters 
+
Biometric signature and/or a Digital Certificate**

## Authorization

-   Ensure that the right person has the access to the right resource
    
-   Access control lists… the most common means
    
-   Often used a back door to compromise the system (it is often easer to move up on the authorization ladder than to get on the ladder in the first place)
    
-   Social Engineering commonly used to “fake” authorization
    
-   Boston College computer frauds are classic cases
    
## Privacy

-   Keep data undecipherable to unauthorized persons
    
-   Not just about encryption
    
-   Not just about technology
    
-   Mostly about people (only people know the derived meaning of data)
    
-   And mostly about intentional misuse of personal data
    
## Cryptography helps maintain privacy

-   To most people, cryptography is concerned with keeping communications private
    
-   Cryptology (from the Greek kryptós lógos, meaning ``hidden word'')
    
-   Encryption is the transformation of data into a form that is as close to impossible to read as possible without the appropriate knowledge (key)
    
-   Decryption is the reverse of encryption
    
-   Encryption and decryption generally require the use of some secret information, referred to as a key
    
## Integrity

-   Keep data free from tampering 
    
-   Not the same as privacy (do not need to understand the data to change it unnoticed)
    
-   Don’t need to know what was changed… just that it was changed
    
## Non-repudiation

-   Provide legally binding proof that a certain transaction took place between certain actors
    
-   Three issues:
    
-   Data non-repudiation (what happened)
    
-   Party non-repudiation (who did it)
    
-   Trusted 3rd party certification (similar to an escrow service)
    
## Availability of Service Issues

-   The popularity of the Internet has made Denial of Service a favorite pastime of certain hackers
    
-   Disruption of service due to worms and viruses
    
-   Hacking a website so as to make it unusable
    
-   File tampering and destruction
    
-   Denial of service attacks have become a form of blackmail and Ransomware
    
## Identity Theft….a growing menace

-   Has become the number one complaint from consumers to Law enforcement dealing with cyberspace crimes
    
-   In the U.S. someone’s identity is stolen every 60 seconds at an average loss of over $6000 to the victim
    
-   Usually achieved with a combination of Social Engineering and hacking
    
-   Involves building a profile of the target from many possible sources and scams

## What do they want?
    
-   Your name 
    
-   Date of Birth 
    
-   Address 
    
-   Telephone numbers 
    
-   Driver's License 
    
-   Credit card account number 
    
-   Bank account number 
    
-   Social Security Number
    
Or any combination of the above!

## Identity Theft

-   How do they get it?
    
-   Emails  - “The Nigerian Letter”
    
-   Phishing and Vishing
    
-   Pharming
    
-   Spoofing
    
-   Intercepting printed mail
    
-   Secret Spybots
    
-   Trojan Horses which capture your keystrokes on your PC and send them to the hacker!
    
## Threats to the Internet Itself

-   What would happen to the global economy if someone successfully attacked the domain name servers that assign all of the internet addresses and URL’s
    
-   Worldwide Chaos
    
-   Huge business failures
    
-   Major disruption to every large national economy
    
-   Major disruption in government services
    
-   Consumer Panic similar to a stock market crash
    
-   Retailing, Travel, Banking, Insurance, Brokerage and News services all crippled
    
-   No more free downloads!
    
## Security Utopia  
-   An illusion is often propagated that the computer system is secure when there are:
    
-   Security guards + video system
    
-   A set of security  policies and procedures
    
-   System backups + fire detection + UPS
    
-   Some smart software and hardware in place 
    
-   Everything is placed in a locked vault…underground
    
-   When in fact this is just a first line of defense….. it is never enough….
    


### A Quote for the Day….
-   Secure web and email servers are the equivalent of heavy armored cars. The problem is, they are being used to transfer rolls of coins and checks written in crayon by people on park benches to merchants doing business in cardboard boxes from beneath highway bridges. Further, the roads are subject to random detours, anyone with a screwdriver can control the traffic lights, and there are no police.

### The Security Pillars
-   Authentication
    
-   Authorization
    
-   Privacy
    
-   Information Integrity
    
-   Non Repudiation
    
-    Availability
    
## Viruses!!

Viruses, Worms, Trojan Horses and Spybots aka, Malware

  

Primarily attack on Authentication,Data Integrity, System Availability and Privacy

## Computer Viruses

-   In the early 1980s, Fred Cohen did extensive theoretical research at USC, as well as setting up and performing numerous practical experiments, regarding viral type programs. 
    
-   Dr. Cohen's definition of a computer virus as "a program that can 'infect' other programs by modifying them to include a ... version of itself" is generally accepted as a standard. 
    
-   Aka….a illicit program hidden inside of a legitimate program that propagates through various computer and network media
    
-   Cohen created “research viruses”  as part of his thesis
    
-   Today we are concerned with viruses “in the wild”
    
### Viruses

-   Malicious software code that is usually embedded in executable programs or documents
    
-   File Infector viruses can sit in a systems memory and attach themselves to any programs that the user opens
    
-   Some viruses actually create new copies of existing programs that contain malicious code and substitute them for the original
    
-   A common technique is to infect Word documents that may then be emailed to other systems
    
-   Famous Viruses in the past were called Chernobyl, Career of Evil, Concept
    
-   The worst viruses destroy the file directory or the data on your Disk!
    
### How do they propagate?

-   Early viruses spread when people exchanged floppy disks that contained programs or data with other users and inserted them into their machines  (relatively slow propagation)
    
-   Today, with the speed and global reach of the internet, viruses can spread many times faster attached to emails, and file downloads such as mp3s, images and video files
    
-   (very fast propagation and attack at a distance)
    
### Types of Viruses

-   File Infector Viruses
    
-   Some of the oldest types
    
-   Looks like an executable file (.exe, .com, .bin, .sys)
    
-   Hides in system memory and embeds itself in applications that the user opens
    
-   Capable of infecting multiple application files
    
-   Some Infector viruses make a copy of the real application and hide themselves inside the copy.  When the user clicks on the file name, the copy runs, not the original.
    
-   Macro Viruses
    
-   Hide in the popular macro commands that are popular in windows applications
    
-   These viruses infect any documents that the application opens (Word, Excel, Access, etc.)
    
### Types of Viruses

-   Boot Sector Viruses
    
-   These viruses infect the boot track of the disk drive when the machine is booted up
    
-   By altering the  boot drive, the virus can render the machine inoperable
    
-   Michelangelo was a famous boot sector virus that launches on computers on March 6th and puts the infected machines out of service
    
-   On March 6, 1992 there was almost hysteria about the effect that this virus would have on all the PCs installed worldwide
    
### Worms

-   Responsible for today’s most widespread attacks and sometimes confused with Viruses
    
-   Unlike viruses, worms are designed to self replicate and automatically spread themselves from system to system using the network connections
    
-   Worms usually use email as their carrier method since email is such a popular application 
    
-   Some worms mail themselves to everyone listed in your address book as an efficient replication mechanism
    
-   The Anna-Kournikova.jpg.vbs worm did over $80 million worth of damage because people couldn’t resist the temptation of seeing a revealing photo of her
    
### The Trojan Horse

### Trojans

-   Modeled after the ancient technique of hiding a threat inside of a seemingly benign package
    
-   Trojans are usually attached to emails and contain a program that performs nasty stuff on your computer
    
-   When the user opens the email, the system resets and when it boots up, the Trojan program does its thing very secretly
    
-   Trojans can open up backdoor communications on your system which allows someone to actually see what you are typing on the keyboard (Usernames, Passwords, CC#s, Phone numbers, SS#s)!!!!!!!
    
-   Trojans can also allow someone to effectively hijack your computer and use it control everything that your machine does without you knowing it (Zombies!)
    
## In Summary

-   A wide variety of threats
    
-   Viruses, Worms and Trojans are sometimes combined in order to confuse the detection and removal techniques
    
-   The attacks continue and get more sophisticated all the time.
    
### How to attempt to protect yourself from  Malware

-   Install Viruses protection software
    
-   Subscribe to the update Service and have the updates installed automatically on your machine
    
-   Perform a complete Virus scan of your machine at least once a week
    
-   Automatically while you are asleep!
    
-   Do not put flash memory cards from unknown parties into your machine
    
-   Only accept software downloads from reputable companies (almost 10% of all the files on popular file sharing sites are in fact Malware)
    
-   Install and run Spybot Search and Destroy regularly
    
-   Don’t open any emails promising racy photos or videos of Anna Kournikova, Pamela Anderson, Paris Hilton or Ben Affleck, George Clooney or Brad Pitt! Or anyone else for that matter….
    
### RansomWare!

Ransomware is a type of malware which restricts access to the computer system that it infects, and demands a ransom paid to the creator(s) of the malware in order for the restriction to be removed.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/D1SwHFbzB5V2IKksPwF60zchs5eUXj4ODbBD0ByK_NWHpLJyQD4AdeZoRSvhB7bLqLs_fZ07lWy3zdBDIfyqfkTn79NC2vkRcM67C_fMibyP35TxX7TyB9qfshtmC6OOZnnen1kKS9vBugk=s2048)

Beware of Bogus Virus Protection! (RansomWare)

-   The user gets a very visible warning about infections on their PC from what appears to be a legitimate source (Microsoft, etc)
    
-   They are instructed to click on a button and download software to protect themselves.
    
-   By doing so they download and install a program that incessantly pops up on their screen instructing them to pay for a viral antidote which disrupts everything else they are trying to do
    
-   They then have to go to a website and pay to remove the annoying software that they mistakenly downloaded in the first place!
    
-   VERRRRY ANNOYING!!!!  and costly
    
### CryptoWall   and CryptoLocker

A file-encrypting ransomware program called CryptoWall infected over 600,000 computer systems  and held 5 billion files hostage, earning its creators more than $1 million, researchers found.

CryptoLocker, another ransomware program that infected over half a million systems over 6 months, earned its perpetrators an estimated $3 Million!

Payment is always required using Bitcoin or another untraceable cyber currency

### Phishing

-   Phishing is the criminally fraudulent process of attempting to acquire sensitive information such as usernames, passwords and credit card details by masquerading as a trustworthy entity in an electronic transaction. 
    
-   Phishing is an example of social engineering techniques used to fool users and exploits the poor usability of current web security technologies. 
    
-   Phishing alludes to baits used to "catch" financial information and passwords.

### Pharming

Pharming is a hacker’s  attack aiming to redirect a website’s traffic to another, bogus website 

Pharming can be conducted either by changing the host’s file on a victim’s computer or by exploitation of a vulnerability in DNS server software. 

[Antivirus software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antivirus_software) and [spyware removal software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spyware_removal_software) cannot protect against pharming. 

Pharming is also known as Page Hijacking

### Phishing Video

These days, Phishing, Pharming and Spoofing are often all combined in the same attempt to compromise someone’s personal information

### Looking for Privacy  
Encryption and Decryption

“Kryptos logos”

(Hidden Word)

Encryption and Data Security   (Privacy)

  -   Cryptography is the art and science of keeping message secret
    
-   Encryption techniques convert data into a secret code for transmission
    
-   The process of retrieving the original message at the receiver is called decryption
    
![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/S8DzXUuPmGIAkZa2JJYQHBzgasPAyeB40VOhbbsVBVVvjs6VVy8jrIx_dzz0TXr_K4-wbT4rYNhbSjxwk3xKCJUWW7wHuyxl5F0jgplsBt3vwxkK_Ntheopgur5GmOBpFIdC-ctqeHH1qEk=s2048)

### Encryption Keys

-   Keys are essential information -- usually a large numerical parameter(s) -- needed for encryption and/or decryption algorithms
    
-   Encryption keys are used to encode plaintext as encoded ciphertext
    
-   Decryption keys are used to decode ciphertext and recover the original plaintext
    
-   Decryption keys were sometimes discovered by brute force methods employing computers to search large potential key combinations
    
Two Types of Encryption using keys

-   Symmetric keys  also know as Secret Key Encryption
    
-   Asymmetric keys also known as Public Key Encryption
    
-   Public Key Encryption aka PKI is now the dominant form of Encryption in use in all digital transactions
    
### Public Key is the Dominant Technique in use today

-   This involves the use of TWO different keys, each over 1000 bits in size
    
-   One key is PUBLIC and published by a Trusted Third Party, known as a Certificate Authority (CA).  This key is contained in a Digital Certificate
    
-   One key is PRIVATE and held secret by its owner
    
-   The Private key owner is registered with the CA and has proven their identity to a specific level of certainty
    
-   The Private key owner can now SEND a message encrypted using the private key to anyone they like
    
-   The Receiver of this message cannot read it without decrypting it
    
-   The Receiver goes to the CA (on the web) and requests the Sender’s Public Key
    
-   The Receiver uses the public key to decrypt the Sender’s message
    
### Who are the Certificate Authorities?

-   CAs  are Bonded, Trusted, Third Party Companies that have been authorized to set up Public Key Infrastructures (PKI) on the Web for the purpose of issuing and managing Public and Private keys for their subscribers
    
-   They operate very secure servers on the web that allow two parties to use the Public Key methods to send secure information over the internet
    
-   Subscribers have to pay to belong and must authenticate themselves to the to the CA periodically to prove who they are.  There are different levels of authentication depending upon the nature of your transactions
    
-   You can see a list of Certificate Authorities in your Browser!

## Public Key Encryption

  -   The first practical public key algorithm was published by Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman in 1976 and is know as RSA (for their last names)
    
-   RSA is still a widely used algorithm which is a testament to its strength and viability
    
-   Public key ciphers employ an algorithm with two keys -- a public key and a private key.  The keys are large PRIME numbers.
    
-   A sender looks up the recipient's public key and uses it to encode a message
    
-   The recipient then decodes the message with his or her private key (this private key is necessary to decode the message)
    
-   This also works in reverse.

Authentication using PKI 

-   The process used to verify the identity of a respondent is called authentication
    
-   Authentication is very important for electronic commerce and other network transactions
    
-   Authentication exploits the symmetry of public and private keys
    
-   To authenticate that a person is who they say they are:
    
-   send that person a nonsense message and ask them to encode it with their private key and return it to you
    
-   when the message is returned, if the person is who they claim to be, you should be able to recover your nonsense message using their public key  which is published
    
## Secure Socket Layer

-   The use of Public Key Infrastructures to secure information exchanges over the web is called the Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
    
-   SSL is the predominate method used to apply RSA and other algorithms for securing email and sensitive electronic transactions 
    
-   Recently, security vulnerabilities were discovered in SSL which potentially could allow unauthorized parties to compromise the method.
    
-   [http://www.howtogeek.com/182425/5-serious-problems-with-https-and-ssl-security-on-the-web/](http://www.howtogeek.com/182425/5-serious-problems-with-https-and-ssl-security-on-the-web/)
    
SSL uses several exchanges to setup the secure link

### Non-Repudiation using PKI

-   If a party is registered with a CA and sends a document or a transaction  encrypted with their secret key to another party they effectively create what is known as a DIGITAL SIGNATURE 
    
-   Digital Signatures are legally binding in the same way your hand written signature is binding  (U.S. Congress and EEC laws)
    
-   It is very difficult to REPUDIATE that transaction since only the sending party knew the secret key in order to create the encrypted message
    
-   The message is read and processed by the receiving party using the Sender’s Public key, which is the ONLY key that will work.  If the Receiver can successfully decode the message then it has proof that the message was generated by the specific sender
    
-   Very important principle when applied to legally binding documents and transactions such as;
    
-   Contracts
    
-   Offers
    
-   Affadavits
    
-   Confidential Information
    
## Stuxnet  --- Who done it ?????

-   Stuxnet is a virus that is widely believed to have been developed by the U.S. and Israeil intelligence communities.  It’s purpose was to infiltrate programmable control systems used in the process control industries.  In particular, this worm was targeted at the controllers that operate the centrifuges used in Iran to process uranium, a key component in the quest for nuclear weapons, or reactors.

### And now, Wiki Leaks and Russian Hacks!!

-   2016 hacks on the DNC mail servers have been blamed by U.S. security experts on state supported Russian hackers who were trying to influence the U.S. Presidential election!   
    
-   And so it goes…...
    
### NotPetya Denial of Service attack    2017

-   Originally targeted at Ukraine by Russian government hackers, the NotPetya virus also found its way into Western European corporate computers that were located in Kiev.
    
-   Maersk Global Shipping, that provides almost 20% of all container shipping worldwide saw all its 40,000 laptops and desktops deployed around the world become corrupted and non functional within hours
    
-   All Maersk cargo was frozen in place since the routing information for each container could not be accessed.
    
-   This attack brought Maersk to its knees for several weeks and required them to re-image all 40,000 computers in order to bring its network back up and resume operations.  
    
-   Several other global firms were affected including Merck Pharma.
    
-   Cost to Maersk:  Over $400M….Cost to Merck: Over $800M

# Digital Audio

Digital Audio  
Turning sound into bits,  
and bits back into sound  

## Introduction to Sound

-   Sounds are vibrations that travel though the air or some other medium
    
-   A sound wave is an audible vibration that travels through air or water.
    
-   The loudness or intensity of a sound is measured in Decibels (dB).
    
-   The frequency of a sound is measured in Hertz (Hz).  1000 Hertz=Kilohertz (kHz)
    
### Properties of Sound

![loudspeaker](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/hXRiu81AiWOqXWCA8NGTqr-KEN3hNjQJHpqZ7hfCxhQpdxw-WkDGdqcR4LKTkt7eKTTit6hgUmbFku2WOkeEQIdxBDMzyuo_ICjh3HzfpAV88HjrYBx4geP3kWamIz6fGtze_jG-meXKPu4=s2048)  
Sound is caused by the disturbance of air molecules by an object that sets those molecules in motion.  Those molecules travel in waves.

### The Range of Human Hearing

-   20 Hz to 20 000 Hz (20 kHz
    
-   Normal Conversation – 
         1 kHz to 4 kHz
-   Dogs can hear up to 35 kHz (ultrasound)

### SOUND WAVE PROPERTIES

-   Amplitude
    
-   Frequency
    
-   Timbre (Harmonics or complexity)
    

Amplitude (Intensity of Sound)

Threshold of hearing
0 dB

Leaves rustling in the breeze
20 dB

A quiet restaurant
50 dB

Busy Traffic
70 dB

Vacuum cleaner
80 dB

Threshold of pain
120 dB

Jet at takeoff
140 dB

## Frequency (Pitch)

Frequency is the most fundamental quantitative unit of sound. When we talk about the radiation of sound, we are talking about an energy transfer in the molecules of air resulting in a moving high pressure (compression) zone traveling at 1130 feet/second. For this sound to have a major significance, it must be composed of multiple high and low pressure zones following each other. The time between the intervals of high pressure zones defines a cycle, and frequency is defined as the number of cycles per second expressed in 

Hertz  (Hz) and KiloHertz (Hz)
For example a Concert A played on a piano is 440 Hz

Representation of a “pure” tone

Variations of air pressure over time for a Sine Wave

## Timber/Pitch

-   Sounds have another perceptual attribute: that of timbre or tone quality. We may describe sounds as being tinny, full, brassy, trumpet-like, etc.
    
-   Timbre is defined as that attribute of a sound that allows us to differentiate between two sounds of the same pitch, intensity and duration

## Capturing Sound Waves

![image004](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/FZGs7FNrIQYUpue1dDzkYuWf9JLzWagLNA7_ilyeAealOTtml4sXgWbwoZenxqhKQ4IJA93hJw7G9sAR3FEDUhsFEkN5FUXZG1zFXwxN5CutL-kQ8z548IEe1xgQLI41Fz2JqPnwW337VgM=s2048)  

## Converting Analog Sound to Digital Sound

-     Analog sound is a continuous phenomena, such as speaking or an electrical pulse from an instrument.
    
-     Computers can only deal with discrete information, so analog sound must be converted to digital, which is called sampling.
    
-   Sampling converts electrical energy to binary code (1’s and 0’s) that is readable by computers.
    
![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/yjSFn1ai4itTvB9zaMaUeqUuanwpV0ctGAfLR3TOqANoJQM4H1lRlvT6fHimOm45W7T2Exc6wumiSiG0F4TiQ_V2HPT75ExwwAYVy8lN3jDcf3_RzGtoFQnqrZkz7p5tkKuHZbatxgytSlg=s2048)  

## Digital Audio - What is it?

-   Really a method to capture and transform audio signals for the purpose of  storage, transmission, manipulation, and playback
    
-   Digital Approximation of the real event and sound waves
    
-   Requires A/D and D/A Converters
    
-   Devices used to change analog to digital and back again.
    
-   These are generally found on computer sound cards
    
-   A/D converters perform sampling of waveforms
    
-   D/A converters convert digital data back into a waveform
    
-   Employ various forms of encoding and decoding the bit stream using CODECS  (Compressor/De-compressors)
    
## Sampling 

  -   Sample Rate: The rate or frequency at which a sound is sampled to digitize it. Measurements of a sound wave over time measured in Hz (cycles/sec).
    
-   48 kHz: standard for digital audio 
    
-   CD audio is sampled at 44.1 kHz
    
-   Bit Rate (Depth): ﻿﻿the number of computer bits that are conveyed or processed per unit of time. 
    
-   Normally expressed in kilobits per second (kbps). 
    
-   A higher bit means generally means better quality (resolution). 
    
-   16 bit: 65,536
    
-   24 bit:  16,777,216

## Analog/Digital Conversion

1.  Microphone converts sound into an electrical signal . 
    
2.  ADC periodically measures (samples) the amplitude of the analog signal, sending a stream of numbers to CPU. 
    
3.  DAC converts a stream of numbers into a stepped analog signal. 
    
4.  Smoothing filter removes staircase shape from signal.

## Buzzword:  Sampling Rate
-   The number of times each second the computer stores information about the sound wave. Compact discs store audio that is sampled at 44.1 kilohertz (kHz). The new DVD format is capable of a maximum of 96 kHz sampling and most computer sound cards can sample at a maximum of 48 kHz. The higher the sampling rate the better the sound quality that will be heard on playback (up to a point)
    
## Buzzword:   Bit Rate
-   Bit Rate: Computers use a binary numbering system of “ones and zeros”. These numbers can be combined into longer strings of numbers in sets, described as “bits”. Compact discs are recorded with a bit length of 16. Again, the higher the bit length, the better the sound quality due to the higher resolution available
    
## Buzz Word:   Compression
-   Computers can use different schemes to eliminate repetitive information when storing data. In the case of recorded sound, these compression schemes can take on many forms that will be dealt with later in this document. Audio on a compact disc is not compressed and gives the user the highest sound quality; when working with the Internet, sound must be compressed to make a smaller file for downloading.   

## The Nyquist Theorem

-   This theorem holds that in order to preserve a reasonable representation of a waveform it must be sampled at least twice at  its highest frequency
    
-   Since the limits of human hearing are around 22khz (22,000 cycles per second), the sampling for CDs was established at 44.1 khz….
      
## How much data on a CD?

One thing about the CD's sampling rate and precision is that it produces a lot of data. On a CD, the digital numbers produced by the ADC are stored as [bytes](http://aes.harmony-central.com/111AES/Content/Webber/PR/WAVEcomp.html), and it takes 2 bytes to represent 65,536 gradations. There are two soundstreams being recorded (one for each of the speakers on a stereo system).  

A CD can store up to 74 minutes of music, so the total amount of digital data that  can be stored on a CD is

44,100 samples/(channel*second) * 2 bytes/sample * 2 channels * 

74 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 783,216,000 bytes

or  176400 bytes or 1,411,200 bits per second!

## CD’s and your Computer

  -   CD standard is 16 bits at 44.1 KHz .  
      
    
-   Using CD Ripper software, you can take digital data from the CD which is in .cda format and convert it to .wav or MP3 format all in the digital domain
    
-   Not dependent upon the sound card capabilities
    
-   The sound file contains all the music but the vast number of samples makes such files big
    
-   Approx: 10 Mbytes per stereo minute

## Digital Compression Concepts

-   Compression techniques are used to replace a file with another that is smaller
    
-   Decompression techniques expands the compressed file to recover the original data -- either exactly or in facsimile
    
-   A pair of compression/decompression techniques that work together is called a codec for short

### What is MP3?  
(Motion Pictures Experts Group Layer 3)

-   MP3 is a compression system developed specifically for music.  It had its birth as a result of the desire to send music over the internet 
    
-   It reduces the amount of data on a CD without “hurting” the sound of the music too much
    
-   It actually achieves a data reduction of about 90%!
    
-   It achieves this dramatic reduction by eliminating things that our ears don’t hear very well
    
-   soft sounds that are masked by louder sounds
    
-   frequencies that are outside of our hearing range
    
-   frequencies that we don’t hear well
    
-   advanced compression techniques
    
### MP3 Takes Advantage of the theory that

-   There are certain sounds that the human ear cannot hear. 
    
-   There are certain sounds that the human ear hears much better than others. 
    
-   If there are two sounds playing simultaneously, we hear the louder one but often cannot hear the softer one   

MP3 is a Lossy Compression System
![mp3-waves](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/1JmxwtHZtpX0U-b7HPw1s8MRXjypycNEOK-HRcAwmAloHEND5R_FU6CPIUVt-m0bnV4NmrwnF1BlwrsqSjCmYkvEbbEJEadl2nx-ybkIIyTusfi8TdFGHuzyOMr33UQqPjsIEk8Y-uummzo=s2048)  

-   MP3 files are an average of 3-5 megabytes vs. CD 
    files of 30 megabytes for the same song
-   Easy to transmit over the internet
    
-   Easy to store on portable devices
    
-   They are an approximation of the original CD which in turn is a reasonable approximation of the real sound
    
### Digital Format Comparison

-   CD Standard = 16 Bits at 44.1Khz
    
-   Professional Digital Recording Standards
    

-   16 or 24 Bits at 44.1Khz, 48Khz, 96Khz
    
-   Wav – Probably the most common format and used by windows programs to capture CD music to a hard drive. Real representation or “Pits to Bits” but files are large
    
-   MP3 – About 1/10 the size, 1meg/stereo minute compared to 10meg for the original and called near CD quality
    
-   WMA – New windows format that boasts higher quality than MP3 with similar sample rates or same quality with lower sample rate and smaller file sizes
    
-   MP4 – A new standard that allows for synchronized video and audio and can compete with WMA. It is non-proprietary
    
## Editing Digitized Sound

-   Digital sound editing is part of a larger field called digital signal processing
    
-   Once sound is digitized, it is in discrete numerical format
    
-   Numerical transformations on this data can be used to:
    
-   change the sound’s pitch
    
-   change the sound’s amplitude
    
-   add echoes and other special effects
    
-   cut and paste entire passages
    
-   Overlay multiple instruments and voices
    
## Audio Speech Synthesis

-   Speech synthesis involves creating speech from written text
    
-   Analysis of written text focuses on breaking the text into phonemes
    
-   English employs approximately 50 basic phonemes
    
-   Rules allow a speech synthesis program to evaluate alternate pronunciations appropriate for the context
    
-   Such rule-based phoneme analysis produces excellent speech synthesis results

## Speech Recognition

-   Speech recognition attempts to interpret digitized speech for meaning
    
-   The task is complicated by the differences among speakers and even the different ways a given speaker might pronounce the same word depending on mood, context, etc.
    
-   Some success has been achieved by tailoring/training a program to recognize a particular speaker
    
-   Some reasonably successful voice activation systems have been produced where vocabulary is limited to small number of words
    
-   Speech recognition remains a very challenging problem

## Summary

-   Digital sound is produced by sampling sound waves over time
    
-   A digital sound file consists of sampled amplitudes at a number of discrete times within a given time interval
    
-   The number of samples per second is called the sample rate
    
-   The number of bits devoted to storing individual sampled amplitudes is called the resolution of the digitized sound: 8-bit, 16-bit and higher resolutions are used depending on the kind of sound being digitized
    
-   Fidelity will be largely determined by the sample rate and resolution

## Digital Imaging   


## The Nature of Visible Light

-   A very small part of the total spectrum of electromagnetic waves
    
-   Unlike sound, electromagnetic waves can travel through a vacuum
    
-   They include the categories of Radio, Microwave, and Visible light waves
    
-   They vary in frequency and amplitude
    
## Electromagnetic Spectrum

![u12l2a1](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/AJgqc6ee3RlmLKAvaKj6FRkye6awD_GRk-jF0zg4mwN3kLTeE1Vo2DCwmeXfs2XCkTRyvd-GJqz5Wc3enSe3yh8RcbV0dCPs5lrEkff2W-T3XT64v5FiLVgU46JPp4_l1CMcF8mm2l8pIEA=s2048)  

## What is light?
-   Normally when we use the term "light," we are referring to a type of electromagnetic wave which stimulates the retina of our eyes. In this sense, we are referring to visible light, a small spectrum of the enormous range of frequencies of electromagnetic radiation.   

-   This visible light region consists of a spectrum of wavelengths, which range from approximately 700 nanometers (abbreviated nm) to approximately 400 nm; 
    
-   that would be 7 x 10-7 meter to 4 x 10-7 meter. This narrow band of visible light is affectionately known as ROYGBIV   

## Fundamental Colors

-   Dispersion of visible light (through) a prism for instance) produces the colors red (R), orange (O), yellow (Y), green (G), blue (B), indigo (I), and violet (V). It is because of this that visible light is sometimes referred to as ROYGBIV

White and Black

-   When all of the colors strike our eye at the same time, we perceive that as WHITE
    
-   Black is defined as the absence of light.  It is actually not a real color
    
## Our eyes

-   The retinas of our eyes contain cells called Rods and Cones.  Rods are sensitive to intensity while cones are sensitive to wavelength (color)
    
-   As it turns out our cones are sensitive to Red, Green and Blue above all else

## Digital Camera Basics
-   A digital camera takes light and focuses it via the lens onto a sensor made out of silicon. It is made up of a grid of tiny photosites that are sensitive to light. Each photosite is usually called a pixel, a contraction of "picture element". There are millions of these individual pixels in the sensor of a DSLR camera
    
## Digital Imaging Basics

-   Image Acquisition
    
-   Digital Image Representation
    
-   Storage Implications and Compression
    
-   Image Processing
    
## Charged Coupled Devices

-   Invented over 40 years ago
    
-   Consists of a 2D array of transistors and capacitors (pixels) that are very sensitive to light
    
-   Photons hit the array which creates and stores electrical charges proportional to intensity of the light
    
-   The values for each pixel are then converted to binary numbers and stored in memory in the camera/computer
    
## CCDs Continued

-   Originally used in spy satellites and astronomy applications due to high sensitivity
    
-   Recent popularity for consumer applications has resulted in dramatic cost reduction
    
-   Now used in every type of imaging
    
-   Replacing film in many applications
    
-   Higher equipment cost, lower operational cost

## Image Acquisition

-   Acquisition determines ultimate resolution
    
-   Remember, you cannot “create” resolution after the fact
    
-   The more samples (pixels) “acquired” the better the resolution (accuracy) 
    
-   The higher the resolution, the more data acquired, hence more storage required

-   typical ratios are 320 X 200 or 1.6:1, 640 X 480, 800 X 600, and 1024 X 768--all of which are 1.33:1
    
## Pixels and Resolution
-   Images are represented (ultimately) as arrays of  pixels (picture elements).
    
-   Image resolution is the number of pixels in the image (e.g., 600x1000)
    
-   Display resolution is the number of pixels in the display device (often expressed in dots per square inch, or dpi).

QUANTIZING a sampled image refers to representing each discrete sample by a set of numbers chosen from a given scale
-   if we assigned a numeric scale for the signal it might look like this
    
## Representing Color

-   The RGB (red, green, blue) color system represents color by specifying the intensity of red, green, and blue light.
    
-   24 bit color would use 8 bits (one byte) for each color.
    
-   In this scheme we specify 8 numbers in base 16 (hexadecimal) = rrggbb.
    
## Representing Grayscale

-   For black and white images we need to represent the shade.  
    
-   A binary image would represent only white or black pixels.
    
-   Four bits per pixel would allow “16 shades of gray”

-   digital images are often processed using “digital filters”
    
-   digital filters are based on mathematical functions that operate on the pixels of the image
    
## Processing Digital Images
![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/RxKppPQLjfbncZhNwb7mlH_FWEK5pL20aaExkGkFJYHTG4IjPZsvgXEL7WvSHDrXm7awwWpdoicq5eVgAbbeVqcLtSn1tDeDyvqP4f33vK1GdbIVLSO8Y2nYSjbFi0BcytteSyKT52UbbQw=s2048)  

-   there are two classes of digital filters: global and local
    
-   global filters transform each pixel uniformly according to the function regardless of its location in the image
    
-   local filters transform a pixel depending upon its relation to surrounding ones
    
## Global Filters
-   Brightness and Contrast control
    
-   Histogram thresholding
    
-   Histogram stretching or equalization
    
-   Color corrections
    
-   Hue-shifting and colorizing
    
-   Inversions
    
## Global Intensity Modification

-   Let us just consider black and white images (so each pixel is represented in, say, one byte = 256 possibilities).
    
-   A global intensity modification technique would change, say, all pixels with intensity 111 to intensity 158.
    
-   Why would one want to do such a thing?
    
## Making a Picture Brighter

To make an overly dark picture brighter, generally raise the light intensity numbers.

### Contrast

![mage result for low contrast vs. high contrast images](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/efnHlS7S0LK0oIr0LXOQKYlNXH5lx4zxAqw-wmgVjc3kzFFYExCwQth7rJGWYvNZ7n52K0ai_wgo_3uzN5geBnSi0mu_gfPsOpd7DNMrPZ3IkfEnzzUAxcbPEJ7XY6Ab50zWIFhD_ttfjiE=s2048)

## Editing Images

-   editing or retouching an image involves selecting a region of the digital image for processing using some special effect
    
-   image compositing combines components of two or more images into a single image
    
-   painting (or rotoscoping) an image is to edit the image by hand with graphic tools that alter color and details
    
## Editing Images

-   compositing images involves combining separate image layers into one image
    
-   layers may be moved and arranged

## Computer Animation

-   Computer animation is simply computer graphics for sequences of scenes designed to be viewed in rapid succession.
    
-   Commercial computer animation is very labor intensive.
    
## Animation and Physics

-   The goal of computer animation research is to model not just how the world looks, but how it changes.
    
-   For example, how do clothes fold when the body inside moves, or how do the limbs of a person (or a dog) move when the person/dog is walking.
    
## Graphics and Image Processing

-   The distinction between computer graphics and image processing is becoming  increasingly blurry.  
    
-   This is because many of the most advanced image processing techniques employ computer graphics ideas like modeling and rendering.
    
## Noise Reduction Techniques

-   Noise in an image is the insertion of random, spurious pixel values because of non-image events like the decay of a photograph, or  errors in the  transmission of the image (as when a picture is transmitted from a satellite to the ground station).
    
## How Can One Remove Noise?

-   One can simply smooth pixel values so that, say, white spots become closer in value to the surrounding pixels.  But this removes contrast generally.
    
-   Better is to locate surface boundaries and remove abrupt intensity changes that do not correspond to boundaries.
    
-   This requires building up an image model.
    
## Graphics and Scene Recognition

-   These techniques require (to a greater or lesser degree) scene recognition - the ability to infer from one or more images what is in the scene, and where.
    
-   Scene recognition is normally considered to be part of AI (Artificial Intelligence - the study of how to make computers behave “intelligently”).
    
## Indexed Color

-   INDEXED COLOR images are derived from full color images
    
-   INDEXED COLOR images are smaller or more compact in storage
    
-   are composed of pixels selected from a limited palette of colors or shades
    
-   They are “browser safe”
    
![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8qgszWAxjLXcD65Bdhg22-3n8VrnNY9UFvhqU-kbagvqnliRR34szAGxokIHJ2KSgJ_TiKywyus1alWlDxiyiGEkaMzNXYjTW2h28SA9pxkeYvpKEKEE6x0UN_W0rxnzEqfRBxXQg9FQdbM=s2048)  

## Digital Image Files

-   Digital images are converted to files for storage and transfer
    
-   The file type is a special format for ordering and storing the bytes that make up the image
    
-   File types or formats are not necessarily compatible
    
-   You must often match the file type with the application (.psd = photoshop)  

## Storing Digital Images

-   TIFF (Tagged Image File Format)
    
-   used by most document preparation programs
    
-   has optional lossless compression
    
-   Windows and Macintosh formats differ
    
-   GIF (Graphic Interchange Format)
    
-   indexed color image (up to 256 colors)
    
-   compressed
    
-   used in Web applications
    
## Storing Digital Images
-   JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)
    
-   lossy compression with variable controls
    
-   also used in Web applications
    
-   WMF (Windows Metafile Format)
    
-   “metafile” formats permit a variety of image types
    
-   PICT
    
-   the metafile format for Macintosh apps

## Quick Review

-   We convert analog image information into digital format by sampling and analog to digital conversion (Quantizing)
    
-   The more samples, the better the resolution hence, more accuracy
    
-   We can reduce resolution but we cannot create it after the fact
    
-   Once in digital form, we can easily modify the image, store it, and send it anywhere in the world!

### Improved Accessibility
### Increased Technical Complexity
## Film vs. Video

-   Film captures motion at 24 frames (Images) per second 
    
-   Video typically operates at 30 frames per second
    
-   Video inherits many of its characteristics from broadcast television, developed in the 1930’s – 40’s
    
## Video Starts off as Analog Information

-   Just as in Imaging, the original information contained in video is analog by nature
    
-   Intensity
    
-   Color
    
-   Speed / Motion (30 Frames per Second)
    
-   Digital technology allows us to convert it to bits, store it and manipulate it much easier than its analog counterpart

##  DVD – Digital Versatile Disk

-   Up to 133 minutes of medium resolution video, with 720 dots of horizontal resolution X 480 dots of vertical resolution  (The video compression ratio is typically 40:1 using MPEG-2 compression.) 
    
-   Soundtrack presented in up to eight languages using 5.1 channel Dolby digital [surround sound](http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/surround-sound.htm) 
    
-   4.7Gb of storage total per disk  

## Blu-Ray High Definition DVD

-   10 times the capacity of std DVD
    
-   Higher resolution:
    
-   Up to 1920X1080 dots of resolution
    
-   Up to 50GB of storage!
    
-   Uses a blue laser as opposed to a red one (shorter wavelength)
    
-   The current high def standard
    
## Video Aspect Ratios
## Advantages and Disadvantages of Digital Video
-   Advantages
    
-   Scalable to different playback systems
    
-   Random access to frames
    
-   Easy to Edit
    
-   More playback options
    
-   Potential for interactivity
    
-   Disadvantages
    
-   High playback and storage requirements 
    
-   ( Who Cares!!)
    
## Video Resolution

-   Standard definition video was typically delivered at 440 X 320 or 720 X 480 depending upon whether it was broadcast, stored on VHS videotape or standard DVD
    
-   High definition video is delivered at:
    
1280 × 720 pixels, 
Or
1920 × 1080 pixels,
Or
3840  x  2160 pixels  

3-5 fold increase in pixel resolution…lot’s more data…
How is it possible that we can afford to transmit this over cable, satellite and over the air given this drastic increase in resolution

## But, there is soooo much data!

-   If we didn’t have a way to efficiently compress all of the information in the video frames, we would quickly run out of cost effective storage capacity for consumer applications.
    
-   Thus the need for 
    
## Compression/Decompression
## Digital Compression Concepts
-   Compression techniques are used to replace a file with another that is smaller
    
-   Decompression techniques expands the compressed file to recover the original data -- either exactly or in facsimile
    
-   A pair of compression/decompression techniques that work together is called a codec for short
    
![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/6WVig18oJaFBYa_Qc-IyalKMzIZ4utm3TLEzcPvdjaq5XY8pTfB6-gaYKf3ap19kgXjNHfBdOJTn31ZYhsLcPjImsIEDQj2J4cACOBYC0bybSOcIkKOo5ezkr2TiQzim_OQ2SrZtZSfeb14=s2048)  
## Redundancy

-   Data compression is possible because many messages (images, etc.) are redundant,  and they can theoretically be reconstructed from a smaller set of bits.
    
## Types of Data Compression

We can divide up data-compression techniques in many different ways:
-   Lossy as opposed to lossless compression
    
-   Syntactic as opposed to semantic compression.
    
## Assumptions
-   One way to look at data compression techniques is to ask what fact about the world they assume.
    
-   Syntactic techniques make very broad assumptions, semantic techniques can depend on very specific ones.   


## Run Length Encoding (RLE)

-   Achieves modest savings with a Syntactic method
    
-   Based on the assumption that redundancy is is present in certain repetitions of ASCII characters or numbers
    
-   ABBCCDDDDDDDDDEEFGGGGG becomes
    
-   ABBCCD#9EEFG#5
    
## Image Compression

-   The basic assumption of image compression is that pixel intensity values do not change much between neighboring pixels.
    
-   So record, say, the center pixel, and work out in a spiral.  For each new pixel, just record the difference between it and the previous one.
    
## JPEG

-   JPEG is set of lossy image compression standards.
    
-   JPEG combines a lossy scheme much like the one we just described, and then further compresses the data using a lossless scheme. If we have a long string of 0’s (no change) this could be represented by a pointer back to a previous such string or the use of Run Length Encoding
    
-   JPEG results in some loss of detail due to averaging as well as slight discoloration
    
## Video Compression:  
Coping with Large Files

-   Video Compression is an encoding process that filters the original file in several successive stages
    
-   Without powerful compression we would NOT be able to produce CDs, DVDs, or Video Downloads over the Internet
    
## Types of Codecs

-   Codecs that upon decompression always reproduce the original file exactly are called lossless codecs
    
-   Codecs that reproduce only an approximation of the original file upon decompression are called lossy codecs
    
-   Codecs that take approximately the same amount of time to compress and decompress a file are referred to as symmetric codecs
    
-   By contrast, codecs that feature simple fast decompression but significantly slower compression are called asymmetric codecs
    
## Codec Methods

-   Syntactic encoding methods attempt to reduce the redundancy of symbolic patterns in a file without any regard to the type of information represented
    
-   Semantic methods consider special properties of the type of information represented to reduce nonessential information in a file
    
-   Hybrid methods combine both syntactic and semantic methods
    
## Compressing Video

-   Video compression employs both spatial and temporal compression techniques
    
-   spatial techniques compress individual frames
    
-   temporal methods compress data in frames over time
    
-   QuickTime and AVI (Audio Video Interleaved) are two popular (and incompatible with each other) compression formats used on PCs
    
## Temporal Compression in Video

-   Lossy strategies for eliminating redundancy of information between frames employ temporal compression -- referred to as interframe compression
    
-   Sequence of frames are considered together
    

-   key frames
    
-   difference frames

## Other Brute Force Methods for Reducing Demands

-   Frame rate adjustment
    
-   slow it from 30 to 24 fps
    
-   Lower resolution on individual frames
    
-   sometimes hard to notice by average viewer
    
## MPEG 2- The Mother of all Video Compression!….so far

-   Uses : Temporal and Spatial Redundancy
    
-   Basically it predicts what subsequent frames of video are going to be based on previous and future frames 
    
-   It encodes that knowledge such that only one out of 12 frames has a complete set of digital binary information….the others have a combo of binary and vector information
    
-   40:1 Compression Ratio…..makes DVDs possible

# Databases and Privacy

Storing, Organizing and Retrieving Data

## What is a Computer Database?    

Answer:
An Organized Collection of Data files that may be added to, deleted, modified and reported on   
  
## Attributes of all files

-   Location
    
-   Size
    
-   Type
    
-   Files have information embedded with the data that defines how the data is organized
    

## Files, Records, and Fields
![atabase](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/q0hv8UWWpYJLl_3L5jpLbf3xS-JaimGnk32lfM0B1rzEgbLFW1-Om_kXgzBnP40nl7SZDQt9GH_BRMttqZzYds0A35tt5OkToCjabCHRCZNJfWdmMNtj9YXlBQK2ZZQCwaNyCwknLRFiS50=s2048)  

The Two Major DBMS Models

-   Flat File Model
    
-   Separate files are linked via physical links (link fields)
    
-   Favored where efficiency and performance are highest priorities
    
-   Relational Model
    
-   Separate files are linked via logical links in the data model
    
-   Favored where flexibility and support for ad hoc queries are highest priority   

## Database Management System  

Data Structure

-   Flat file systems use only one file to model and store data
    
-   Many database problems will require multiple (but related) files for data modeling
    
-   Database structure must always be defined upfront
    
-   records and fields must be defined
    
-   field data types must be specified
    
## Using Multiple Files 

-   Relationships must be specified when database structure is defined
    
-   Logical links are made explicit by linking appropriate fields in different tables
    
![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/9vBkSWMseggW3r_wDQKQhN_T3yjN479Z_wKEqteyu2iPaeAAHr5pFn-01BrnEO7va_JdbFwhFhgi4QxAF70a2Lt5oi7Bw3Bt2muKXXaZMbaPryR7KWTmqPl0VmgFntPjNRcJYYY2F-aENCU=s2048)  

## Database Management System  

## Accessing the Data
-   Forms are often used for entering/viewing data
    
-   Queries are constructed to retrieve data satisfying specific criteria
    
-   Data can be sorted in multiple nested levels
    
-   Reports are constructed (often based on queries)
    
## A Form for Entering Fields
![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/oT7pSzovWCUUIDKoxyKCO2KMM3hqjybJsSc_wdhY8vkgqAuHfqz1uYD_4L9XVwTfUmhRuw-NQv9b2-sCfJA9pIPm8eHJnJmpxWX5p-VYOyCNwphwRhQH6jZxTmR6V8fVVEkmN5br4qtpBAI=s2048)  

## Example Report in Access
![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/iYLu0PA-po9Q3mTarDG64avCe8L3mxyQYoeba7CygwcvaHhbY_UD08_krFeDqEZMbmOW5Mf4p7SNNEZnr6ZGpW9oW8na_JGShWXH9AnhMjWEwZvag8qO3GN55XYXytXA0zG1_7u2aFi4OHc=s2048)  

## Query Languages

-   Query languages, like programming languages, have specific syntax
    
-   These are more user-friendly than most programming languages
    
-   SQL (Structured Query Language -- often pronounced “sequel”) is a de facto standard
    
## Query Construction

-   Queries are structured to retrieve data from specified fields in indicated tables (files) in a database
    
-   Retrieved data must satisfy particular search constraints
    
-   Boolean operators -- especially logical and and logical or -- allow the construction of multiple search constraint queries
    
## Example Queries -- SQL

-   SELECT Name FROM Sales WHERE Amount > 5000 AND Region = “West”
    
-   SELECT Name FROM Sales WHERE (Amount > 5000 AND Region = “West”) OR (Amount > 2000 AND Region = “Midwest”)
    
## Summary

-   Databases are Software that manages the storage and retrieval of data dates from the early days of computing
    
-   There are two primary database models today: the flat file model and the relational model
    
-   The network model provides excellent performance; the relational model provides excellent flexibility
    
-   The first step toward creating any database is the definition of the structure of the data to be modeled
    
## Summary (cont’d)

-   All database management systems provide the ability to define data entry forms and reports for output
    
-   Query languages provide user-friendly access to database data
    
-   Queries are defined to retrieve data that matches (or satisfies) specified search constraints
    
-   SQL has become the de facto standard for query languages
    
## Database Products in Widespread Use

-   Oracle
    
-   Informix
    
-   Microsoft Access
    
-   Microsoft SQL
    
-   MySQL
    
-   PostgreSQL
    
## Databases and Individual Privacy

## Data to fight crime and terrorism  

Lessons learned as a result of 9-11

-   Too much data can be a liability 
    
-   Data on the same topic kept in different systems
    

-   Is not effective unless it is linked together
    
-   Sometimes requires filtering to remove “irrelevance”
    
The highly controversial Patriot Act has expanded the 

Scope of data that the Govt. can collect and use on you

## Social Significance

-   Every one of us is profiled in several databases around the country many of which are linked to each other:
    
-   Financial, insurance and credit systems
    
-   Medical systems
    
-   Court, Justice and Crime systems
    
-   Retailer systems
    
-   Websites
    
-   Govt. systems (Municipal, State and Federal)
    
## On Line Privacy

-   On-Line Privacy is an Oxymoron.  If you are connected to a network, chances are that someone, somewhere has the capability to keep track of you.
    
## How private is my credit report?

-   Credit reports are a gold mine of information about consumers. They contain Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, telephone number (including unlisted numbers), credit payment status, employment, even legal information about court proceedings
    
## Who has access to my report?

-   Those considering granting you credit. 
    
-   Landlords. 
    
-   Insurance companies. 
    
-   Employers and potential employers (but only with your consent). 
    
-   Companies with which you have a credit account for account monitoring purposes. 
    
-   Those considering your application for a government license or benefit if the agency is required to consider your financial status. 
    
-   A state or local child support enforcement agency. 
    
-   Any government agency
    
## Who are the people that store and provide information about you?

-   Equifax
    
-   Experian
    
-   Transunion
    
-   Link to Equifax:
    
-   [Equifax Personal Solutions Credit Reports, Credit Scores, Protection Against Identity Theft and more](http://www.equifax.com/)
    
## Financial Services Modernization Act  

also known as Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act or GLB  
  
-   Allows banks, insurance companies, and brokerage firms to operate as one. The combined companies have been aptly dubbed "financial supermarkets." 
    
-   They may promise you such benefits as consolidated account statements and lower fees. But at the same time, the ability of these companies to merge customer data from several sources and even sell it to third parties represents a real risk to your privacy   

## What are your rights under GLB?

-   Privacy Policy: Your financial institution must tell you the kinds of information it collects about you and how it uses that information. 
    
-   Right to Opt-Out: Your financial institution must explain your ability to prevent the sale of your customer data to third parties. 
    
-   Safeguards: Financial institutions are required to develop policies to prevent fraudulent access to confidential financial information. These policies must be disclosed to you
    
## Opt-Out / Opt-In

-   "Opt-out" is contrary to the "opt-in" approach preferred by most consumer and privacy advocates. 
    
-   Opt-in prohibits a financial institution from sharing or selling your data if you do not give your affirmative consent. 
    
-   With opt-out, you give your implied consent by failing to return the privacy notice sent to you by your financial company. So, if you say nothing, it means "yes, you can share my data."
    
## So What?

-   If you Opt In, then you can prevent sharing of your details.  It may be harder to obtain credit at a competitive price however.
    
-   If you Opt Out, then your info is in the financial supermarket and your creditworthiness is easily   determined and you get approval

## Can Google access my data?  
  
It collects data on what videos you watch, the ads you click, your location, device information, and IP address and cookie data. ... Finally, Google promises that it doesn't sell your data, but rather uses your information to “make ads relevant” while you're browsing the web.

## Does Google read your Email?

-   Make no mistake, Google can and does read your email. And this should cause concerns about security and privacy. 
    
-   Because Googles servers have access to all of your organization's emails, an attacker that's able to penetrate these servers can also get all of your data.
    
## Does Instagram sell your date?

-   The study found that Instagram collects 79 per cent of its users' personal data and shares it with third parties, including search history, location, contacts and financial info. “Any information you agree to be gathered by an app when signing up can be analysed for their benefit and even shared

# Data Science, What is it?

-   Data science encompasses preparing data for analysis, including cleansing, aggregating, and manipulating the data to perform advanced data analysis. Analytic applications and data scientists can then review the results to uncover patterns and enable business leaders to draw informed insights.
    
-   In other word, figuring out how to use your behavior and data for maximum gain and competitiveness
    
# What is Computer Science?

-   Not using a computer
    
-   Not just programming
    
-   A field at the intersection of Math, Engineering, etc

-   Who are Computer Scientists?
    
-   Computer Scientists study lots of things
    
-   e.g., "What are Algorithms Theoretically Capable of?“
    
-   Can Machines Think?
    
-   Today we're going to look at the applied version: Programming
    
## Computer Programmers
 “Their rumpled clothes, their unwashed and unshaven faces, and their uncombed hair all testify that they are oblivious to their bodies and to the world in which they move. These are computer bums, compulsive programmers.”
## Computer Science as the New Literacy

-   The modes of thought that come from CS are influencing a huge number of fields
    
-   Modeling & Simulation
    

-   We can create all sorts of worlds inside the computer to work with

## What does a computer do?

-   Computers internally just keep doing the same thing over and over:
    
-   Get the next instruction
    
-   Do whatever it says
    
-   Go back to step #1  
      
    
-   But its internal instructions are in binary -- too hard for people to understand easily

## Formal Languages

-   A program usually just a document -- a written list of instructions
    
-   You saw some of this with HTML -- A markup language is sort-of a programming language

-   Some simple ones are built in to programs you use every day
    
-   Excel is a programming language (and contains another)
    
-   Word Macro Language
    
-   There are also General Purpose Programming Languages
    
## Pseudocode

-   There are lots of details to programming languages
    
-   We’ll also use something called “pseudocode”
    
-   Most of the way to a programming language
    
-   Excludes some details
    
-   With some plain English mixed in
    
## Some Core Concepts

-   (A quick taste of what you'll be learning in Python)
    
-   State
    
-   Expressions
    
-   Variables
    
-   Control
    
![python](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_B8CEwXBWpGEOiN_sylDGmMxPiEqnzXDG-fmntazupCGIGDjev-tFzq7irg6Y6zR-s64l233IlkN06w4A20lfx1c4OaKak_TggSAMXxwQyfzAMvf1E4aLGsGvgAAERats8WCYf2IsN0B8Jk=s2048)  

## State
![chessboard](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/hgEFp-TGT32OVCjyMEMTgVGQ-cMjfTdNgZfyXljUyS782HmFv9bRf6bTgdSWmvgOoT5t0RaY-m3Ym2q-zzWXdNrZpTeeKM-0H5PcbdJrU1y3OjGNd7kapcE0_d-DMZ_idyTED31FlRUKD8I=s2048)

## Expressions

> print “Hello”

  Hello

> print (5+3)  
8

>print (5*5-2)  
23

## Variables

-   Not exactly like Algebra
    
-   In Algebra x=5 (or 5=x) expresses a truth
    
-   In a program, x=5 updates something in the computer’s memory
    
-   (and 5=x wouldn’t work: it’s not a valid statement)
    
## Control Structures

-   Lets you make decisions
    
-   for, while, …
    
if(x>5):

   print (“x is big”)

Else:

   print (“x is small”)

## Programs

 “The computer programmer is a creator of universes for which he alone is responsible. Universes of virtually unlimited complexity can be created in the form of computer programs.”

![escher](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/dvUuJNEvhNdipLWW1b-Wz1DAuYCCfUv7S3bJiB0MnOpmH4WVcNzjaa_P4_q0vXpBLejiTpoV9kjZxj-3s7SJBULn-pRmowfP0dzgrm83W-Y5eb9QToJy6sXB_a9KAekk3Eidu3J0Cni4wXU=s2048)  

## Complexity

Controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming

-Brian Kernigan   
  
## The Process

![nterpreter](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/uzi4GLrSnCOzVkduLexwqyZeVeAGncs8is6w0ikMrJ-VOCUaKgFbp8OwmajGBxPaAaleRXQA0ZjPo5PigfVmIhF4DLLOSjyK5jmW5cfGU6WoA0RxuORHpq56vO-Ql4fOzRHUv2IC8GvXCq4=s2048)  

## But what do you DO?

-   Design
    
-   Requirements
    
-   Use cases
    
-   Pseudocode
    
-   Formal Code
    
-   Test
    
-   Debug
    
![working](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/pr4wNqcPcjxv1DoH6T7e0zr2bfzRf9mr_42a9MBexGLUueJnsjPHRGRn_P-zaUbbkj_5QuH0aSeKrtIl1XHVf4kgIuj1qTfOylviRwyesee-ZgzoEi2TgGsvk57eVzVDKdIIKbugYxpIW8s=s2048)  

## Design

-   Most programming is not done sitting in front of a computer
    
-   You need to really understand what the program will do
    
-   How it interacts with the user
    
-   And how it is structured internally
    
![thinker](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/D76SXAy9opE7DGhf-U-RghP9joy4z4hlloN1432KCSQq1g7-ceo6ieHe6QbdMPaV7wdAx-bmTlMJp8FEFUz-KJ4yDJ40MNl6k4calps1Le3_993m74t5iK-w67qmekptn9bNbqdj9k4adKo=s2048)  

Mostly, when you see programmers, they aren't doing anything. One of the attractive things about programmers is that you cannot tell whether or not they are working simply by looking at them. Very often they're sitting there seemingly drinking coffee and gossiping, or just staring into space. What the programmer is trying to do is get a handle on all the individual and unrelated ideas that are scampering around in his or her head.  
  
Charles M Strauss   

## Test

-   Testing a complicated program is difficult
    
-   Some people write the tests before the programs
    

 “Programming is like sex, one mistake and you have to support it for the rest of your life.”

## Debug

-   At the beginning, much of your time
    
-   In many ways more challenging than coding
    
-   When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. – Sherlock Holmes

## What is Python?

-   A REAL Programming Language!
    
-   Developed in 1990 by Guido Van Rossum in the Netherlands
    
-   Named after Monte Python’s Flying Circus!
    
-   Openly available at no charge!
    
-   Freely distributed on the Web
    
-   Lot’s of Libraries of Python Routines available
    
-   Increasingly popular for writing scripts for the Web
    
## How does Python work?

-   It is an INTERPRETED Language, (Like HTML and Java) so that it is easy to write and execute programs in an interactive mode
    
-   It has a very clear and easy Syntax
    
-   It is portable so it  runs on many different Operating Systems and Machines (Windows, MacOS, Linux, Unix, etc)
    
## What are we going to do with Python in CS2?

-   Learn some basic commands and capabilities of the language
    
-   Printing data, evaluating expressions, inputting data, variables, loops, decisions, functions, boolean expressions
    
-   Learn how to use the programming environment
    
-   Learn how to write simple but useful programs
    
## What tools will you require?

-   You will need the Python  Interpreter and programming environment
    
-   Already installed on the computers in the LAB
    
-   Can be downloaded and installed  on your personal machine from:
    
-   [www.python.org](http://www.python.org/)
    
-   Hint…to be safe install the 32 bit version for your OS
    
-   You will need the Python Tutorial
    
## General Conventions

-   Python is Case Sensitive!…Be Careful!
    
-   Anything you name (variables, etc) must be referred to exactly as initially typed
    
-   Python Commands are always in lowercase!
    
-   Comments can be inserted anywhere by using a “#” before the comment text
    
-   Some commands require indentation to work properly
    
## Variables
  
-   You can think of variables as labeled jars that store different types of data. While there are several kinds of variables, today we're only going to look at two:
    

## String Variables

-   Strings are literal collections of text characters
    
-   Strings must be enclosed in either single or double quotes
    
-   Strings may be manipulated by a variety of operators (repetition, concatenation, etc)
    
-   Concatenation example
    
-   word = “abc”
    
-   word = word + “def”
    
-   print (word) you will get:     abcdef
    
## More String Operations

-   String Repetition
    
-   word = “Yo! ”
    
-   print (word* 5)
    
-   Results in   Yo!Yo!Yo!Yo!Yo!
    
## String Variables

-   String - A string variable is a string of alphanumeric characters and allowed symbols that are contained within quotation marks. For example, "Hello world, I'm 102 years old today!" is an example of a string. 
    
-   Strings are basically used for storing text
    
-   Example:  greeting = “Good Morning Sunshine!”
    
## Number Variables

-   Number - A number variable couldn't be more straightforward because all number variables store are numbers. You don't store them within quotes like strings. Instead, numbers can just be written as they are. If you want to store the number 9 in a variable, you just write 9
    
-   Example:  my_bank_balance = 9
    
or….    pi=3.14

## Our First Program

-   A program that prints a greeting!
    
-   print (“Hello, World!”)
    
-   When this program runs, it outputs…          Hello, World!
    
-   The text inside of the quotes in the program is referred to as a String, or String Variable
    

## Another way to achieve the same  

result
-   greeting = “Hello, World!”
    
-    print (greeting)
    
-   The output is     Hello, World!
    
-   Note that we assigned the variable name greeting with the value of the literal string inside of the quotes.
    
## Expressions 

-   Another more complicated program:
    
-   print (“2 plus 2 is”, 2+2)
    
-   print (“3 times 3 is”, 3*3)
    
-   print (“35 divided by 5 is”, 35/5)
    
-   The output will be: 2 plus 2 is 4 3 times 3 is 9 35 divided by 5 is 7
    
## Operations on Numbers

-   Operation Symbol Example
    
-   Exponentiation      5  2 == 25
    
-   Multiplication       * 2 * 3 == 6
    
-   Division                 / 14 / 3 == 4                                                14 / 3.0 == 4.6666
    
-   Remainder       %     14 % 3 == 2
    
-   Addition                 +      1 + 2 == 3
    
-   Subtraction          -     4 - 3 == 1
    
## More Variable Assignment Examples

-   value = 4*8
    
-   net_price =4.56
    
-   repeat_word = “word” * 5 
    
-   Variables are created and recognized dynamically, that is when they appear in your program with a value assigned to them
    
-   Variables must be assigned before you refer to them otherwise an error will occur
    
-   The values that are assigned to variables in Python are called Objects, each object having a reserved place in memory with a pointer connecting it to the assigned variable
    
## Variable manipulation

-   Variables can be used in conjunction with themselves to affect certain operations;
    
-   Example:
    
-   speed=3
    
-   speed=speed+4
    
-   speed=speed*3
    
-   print (speed)      
    
-   WHAT is the output of this program?   

## Printing variables

-   Variables may be printed by themselves or in succession
    
-   Example
    
number = 9

bignumber = 55

print (number)

print (bignumber)

print (number ,  bignumber)

(puts them on the same line)

## Inputting Data into your program

-   We will focus on user input which is the simplest type and suitable for our purposes
    
-   Input command syntax is:
    
speed = input (“enter speed “)                 

Ok, so let’s write a simple program with the stuff that we have covered so far

-   # A simple program to check our travel progress
    
-   name = input ("enter your name: ")
    
-   speed = int(input("enter your average speed: "))
    
-   time =  int(input("enter your exact travel time in hours: "))
    
-   print (name + " your distance travelled is exactly ",speed*time, " miles")
    
-   print ("the end")
    
 “That's what's cool about working with computers. They don't argue, they remember everything and they don't drink all your beer.”  
  
# Artificial Intelligence  
Can Computers Think?

## What is AI?

-   It is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs.
    
-   Artificial Intelligence is the study of the computations that make it possible to perceive, reason and act.
    
## Artificial Intelligence

-   Artificial intelligence is concerned with understanding the nature of intelligence through the creation of computer programs which control machines.
    
-   It is normally divided up into various sub-disciplines such as vision, learning, language, planning, motion, etc.
    
## Artificial Intelligence

-   Artificial Intelligence becomes a formal branch of Computer Science around 1956
    
-   AI has its own computer programming languages LISP, which developed in 1957, is STILL in use today, along with others
    
-   Every major computer technology company has a considerable investment in AI research
    
## The Mind-Body Problem

-   The major philosophical issue related to AI in computer science is the mind-body problem -- how the mind relates to the body as espoused by Rene Descartes
    
## Mental Life

-   People (and presumably some animals) have a mental life.
    
-   Consider the question “what would it be like to be a bat?”
    
-   Mental life is made up of sensations (color, pain, smells, touch,etc.), emotions and  thoughts etc.
    
## The Mind Body Paradox

1 - Bodies are physical.
2 - Minds are not physical.
3 - Minds and bodies interact. 
4 - The physical and non-physical can't interact. 

Any three of this propositions are compatible but all four together are not….  

## Cartesian Dualism

-   Cartesian dualism as espoused by Rene Descartes claims that mental activity is governed by different laws, and is made up of different stuff than purely physical activity.
    
-   The major problem with this theory for science is that nobody has every seen such stuff, or observed such laws.
    
## Physicalism

-   Physicalism  contends that mental activity and physical brain activity are the same thing.
    

Here is Where Computers Enter the Picture.

-   Computers today to some degree make physicalism seem less plausible. 
    
-   “What is it like to be an Apple iBook?”
    
-   Presumably our answer would be “not much”.
    
-   Would our answer change if the computer were talking to us and having a conversation?   


## So, Can Computers Think?

Not yet…but who knows what the future holds in store?

-   Either way there are important philosophical ramifications.
    
## The “Chinese Room” Problem

-   Imagine a person sitting in a room, and who does not understand Chinese. 
    
-   This person is given a manual on how to respond to all possible sequences of Chinese symbols.
    
-   To the outside world, the person in the room seems to understand Chinese, but does not.
    
-    The same should be said about computers.
    
## Just Wait for Our Intuitions to Change!

Many things that we currently take for granted at one time seemed very implausible.
-   Computation and logic can be carried out in the absence of consciousness.   

## The Promise of AI

-   Some Machines that “Think”, or at least give the appearance that they do….
    
-   Robots
    
-   Expert Systems
    
-   Automation
    
-   Natural Language Processors
    
## Results To Date

-   Software that analyzes other systems and software
    
-   Software that “learns” and never forgets
    
-   Very reliable robotic systems at decreasing cost
    
-   Problem Solvers
    
-   Computer Chess and other Games

## Machine (Computer) Vision

-   Computer vision is concerned with reconstructing the objects and their placement in a scene from one or more  arrays of light intensities generated by these objects.
    
-   It is a very complicated problem.
    
-   That we and other animals do it so effortlessly speaks highly of evolution.
    
## Line Detection

-   Early vision (things that are done early in the vision process) is generally concerned with line detection.
    
-   Lines are places where there is a sharp change in light intensities.
    
-   Noise often complicates things, so it is necessary to smooth the observed light intensities.
    
Three Causes of Lines

Line caused by reflectance change.

Line caused by object orientation change.

Line caused by object boundary.

## Early Vision and It’s Uses

-   So far we have been talking about early vision:  line detection, stereo, texture.
    
-   Some tasks require not much more than this, e.g. driving a car on a highway.
    
## Object Recognition

-   More advanced machine vision is concerned with object recognition.
    
-   Problem involve how to represent object shapes and sizes, how to map such representations when an object is seen at different angles
    
## Some Applications for Object Recognition

-   Manufacturing Quality Control
    
-   Medical Research
    
-   Navigation over terrain (Guidance systems)
    
-   Facial Analysis (Security Systems)
    
-   Robots

## Machine Learning

-   Machine learning is the creation of new hypotheses by computers (or at least hypotheses new to the computer).
    
-   Today most machine learning programs use statistical techniques, and there is, in general, a great cross fertilization between Statistics and Artificial Intelligence.
    
## Planning

-   Planning is deciding what action to take next.
    
-   Within AI planning problems are generally thought of as coming in two varieties:  planning with and without complete information.
    
## Game Playing

-   One standard planning problem is game playing.
    
-   Games like chess are examples of planning with complete information since one knows the exact state of the game board, and nothing else affects the play of the game
    
Game Trees with known rules

My possible first moves.

Initial state of the board

State after move 1

State after move 2

My opponents possible moves.

State after move 2 followed by  my opponents move 1

## Using the Game Tree

-   In principle one can decide on a move by considering all possible responses to responses …
    
-   In practice one cannot carry this out to the end of the game..
    
-   So one carries it out as far as one can….
    
## Chess Playing

-   Many of the worlds best chess players are computers.
    
-   A computer (IBM’s Deep Blue) beat the Gary Kasparov, the world champion in 1997 in a one on one tournament using the tree technique..
    
## Number of possible moves in a chess game

-   There are over 288 billion different possible positions after four moves each. The number of distinct 40-move games is far greater than the number of electrons in the observable universe…..
    
## Pretending the Information is Perfect

-   In many cases one needs to plan without perfect information, scheduling a factory floor, airport terminal gates, transportation of supplies.
    
-   If things break down, or don’t arrive, analyze the result and re-plan
    
## Planning Under Uncertainty

-   Some of the time, however, the future is very uncertain.
    
-   Should one send an airplane to pick up people if you are not sure where the people are, if the airplane will make it, or if they really want to be picked up?
    
## Utility Theory

-   A standard tool for reasoning in such situations is utility theory.
    
-   Actions have costs, and possible outcomes with certain probabilities.  Do the action for which the sum of P(outcome)*Utility of outcome - cost is the greatest.
    
## Speech Recognition and Natural Language Programs
  
  -   Very difficult problem
    
-   Recognizing words and simple phrases vs. complex thoughts and syntax
    
-   Cultural nuance and Context
    
-   Pattern recognition on different speech patterns and accents
    
-   Used by the “Turing test” as the ultimate test of computer intelligence
    
## The Loebner Prize ($100K)

-   Awarded each year to the computer program that best responds to a team of human questioners and best mimics another human being in what is called the “Turing Test”
    
-   Turing asked the question, “ If a computer could be made to think, how would we tell?”…have a conversation with it…..?
    
## Chat bots

A Chat bot is a program that attempts to simulate typed conversation, with the aim of at least temporarily fooling a human into thinking they were talking to another person. 

Chat bots are lightweight Natural Language Programs.

## Heuristics

-   For a given set of circumstances, what should be done?
    
-   What information can be used as input into the decision process?
    
-   What weight should be given to different pieces of data?
    
example: approving a credit card purchase   
  
## Robotics

-   The ultimate exercise in planning and action is in the area of robotics.
    
-   The current state of robotics is still fairly primitive.  Our sensors typically do not tell us much about the environment with much certainty, and our effectors do not work all that well either.
    

## Robotic Sensors

-   Infared
    
-   Lasers
    
-   Temperature
    
-   Humidity
    
-   Liquid
    
-   Micro Switches

## IBM’s Artificial Brain

-   IBM has recently unveiled its Blue Gene Artificial Brain.
    
-   Has the computing power of a cat’s brain but is only 1/83rd as fast as a human brain
    
-   Consists of 147,000 interconncted processors and consumes 1,000,000 watts of power and has 150,000 Gigabytes of memory!

## Self Awareness

-   Can machines be made Self-Aware?
    
-   Implies that at some point they might not need further programming….they do it themselves….just like a new born infant does from the time it is born!
    
-   The machines could then decide whether or not they like us…and if they should keep us around!
    

## Self Awareness in Popular Culture

-   Science Fiction from Asimov, Phillip Dick, Arthur Clarke, Brian Aldiss and others…
    
-   Robots
    
-   Malevolent Computers
    
-   Artificial Worlds
    
-   Androids and Replicants
    
-   Self Aware Machines the enslave mankind
    

## Asimov’s Robotics Laws

Over-riding Law: A robot may not injure humanity, or, through inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.  

Law One: A robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm, unless this would violate a higher order law.  
  
Law Two: A robot must obey orders given it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with a higher order law.  
  
Law Three: A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with a higher order law.  

[Isaac Asimov](http://inventors.about.com/gi/dynamic/offsite.htm?site=http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/books/isaac-asimov-faq/part3/faq.html)

Given the uncanny accuracy that science fiction has for predicting the future…who knows?…

"I have no hesitation in thinking  
that a machine can be just as intelligent and just as real as a person, in principle."

Recent announcement by Alphabet, Google’s parent company, about early results from their Quantum Computer development.

Google has claimed "[quantum supremacy](https://www.livescience.com/65651-quantum-computers-get-scary-fast.html)" over the most powerful supercomputers in the world by solving a problem considered virtually impossible for normal machines.

The quantum computer completed the complex computation in 200 seconds. That same calculation would take even the most powerful supercomputers approximately 10,000 years to finish,

Q-BITs can have the value of 0 and 1 at the same time!

Stay tuned as this and other Quantum experiments evolve.

# Computer Gaming, Entertainment and other Cool Applications

## Early Computer Games

-   Early Popular games were of the “Adventure” format that were played on the computer console of Mainframe Computers
    
-   Designed by Programmers for Programmers
    
-   “Adventure” by William Crowther
    
-   Star Trek
    
Text based, no graphics, player kept their own maps or notes
These games were designed and written by bored systems programmer to pass the time while waiting for programs to run

## The Opening Line for “Adventure”

You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building. Around you is a forest. A small stream flows out of the building and down a gully   
  
Adventure
YOU ARE IN A SPLENDID CHAMBER THIRTY FEET HIGH. THE WALLS ARE FROZEN RIVERS OF ORANGE STONE. AN AWKWARD CANYON AND A GOOD PASSAGE EXIT FROM EAST AND WEST SIDES OF THE CHAMBER.   

## Star Trek Demo

-   With this tremendous growth (10.2% YoY to be precise) has come a flurry of investments and acquisitions, everyone wanting a cut of the pie.
    
## Computer Game Technology

-   Due to extreme price/performance pressure, video console game hardware is designed specifically for the purpose of running gaming software at lowest cost
    
-   As such, PCs don’t usually perform on games as well as these special “boxes”…but of course, PCs are much more versatile
    
-   Many game enhancement products exist for PCs however so that games can crossover to that market
    
## Gaming Software

-   Much of the critical software is written in lower level code to enhance execution speed
    
-   Many of the gaming consoles have special machine instructions designed specifically for game functions      
  
## Physics Engines 

Realistic Motion is achieved with specially
designed software “physics engines” that 
perform the calculations for objects that are 
moving through the game space at high speeds

## Physics Engines

-   Libraries of programs that contain:
    
-   Physical Characteristics of the objects
    
-   Height
    
-   Weight
    
-   Mass
    
-   Velocity
    
-   Formulas for all possible combinations of reactions against that object
    
Physics Engines, don’t always have to follow the laws of Physics!
Sometimes you want to be able to take a left turn at 400 mph !!!!           

## Video Gaming Graphics

-   Seamless high resolution video processing is the key to high quality games today
    
-   Special video hardware that processes more megabits per second is the name of the game here coupled with very efficient vector graphics software
